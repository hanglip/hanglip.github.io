And they’re cravenly taking advantage of the fact that, for all the reasons that I just described, these are people that are politically invisible; they don’t have muscle. Many of them are domestic guest workers in the country; they signed paperwork that says they’re only here to work in fields, that’s all, and when they’re done, they return home. Or else they’re not documented, and so what are they going to do when they’re exploited? Sue? They have no standing, and so that’s being cravenly exploited.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We need a food system that is fungible, that has redundancy built in. The so-called efficiencies that have been built into the highly specialized industrial model that we have right now, we are now learning, do not serve us when you have a situation where a single thing that is unpredicted takes out one pillar of the food system, and then the whole thing comes crumbling down. That’s not the kind of food system that we need. We need one that is more distributed, meaning that there are more nodes within the food system that can respond in the volumes and quantities and the formats that are necessary for where people are going to be using this food.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Now, a very good example of that is that the farmers that are doing well right now are the so-called small-scale family farmers. These are folks that produce in volumes, and who redistribute in local and regional networks, where they can respond very quickly, to where the schools are now becoming redistribution points for SNAP, for instance, or for school food that needs to be picked up by students that otherwise might not have access to that food, because they’re not coming to school every day, and so on. Or through farmers markets, another very important redistribution method which is very fungible. So we’re learning that that’s actually what works; we need to invest more in these kinds of highly distributed systems, and less in the highly concentrated systems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Probably the single most influential agricultural lobby is the American Farm Bureau Federation. They say they represent farmers, but they actually represent agribusiness.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>And by the way, I’ll remind everyone that we’re living in a time where, to quote Noam Chomsky a couple of weeks ago, every fiscal conservative is hiding their copy of Ayn Rand and is lining up for benefits from the nanny state. There’s a lot of hypocrisy that we need to throw in these people’s faces, because that’s the urgency that the degree of exploitation and dysfunction that we’re living through demands.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We all have different takes on wages.

It is, for example, one of the problems with permacture: whereas a wool producer knows when s/he will shear, and more or less when and what s/he will be paid, there are few permaculture applications allowing predictable income. It is not <em>impossible</em> to plan, just rare to see permaculture entities that <em>do</em> &lsquo;plan for the bank&rsquo;.

England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were &ldquo;mysteriously&rdquo; unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out &ldquo;how many people&rdquo;, contributing &ldquo;how many pounds&rdquo;, for &ldquo;how many weeks&rdquo; from their wages, would take &ldquo;how long to pay cash for a house&rdquo;. The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every &ldquo;loan clubber&rdquo; at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Putting it another way, because of their &hellip; racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>This was at a time when &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to live next to one&rdquo; and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves &ldquo;able&rdquo; to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don&rsquo;t need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>In practice, what were the details? Let&rsquo;s say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That&rsquo;s 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That&rsquo;s slightly less than 8 years.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>Bad luck, racist banks! The people got 400 houses without your loans! You should have been wide awake instead of lolling around &hellip; What? you were &lsquo;having a midlands&rsquo;? Too bad.

Being unaware of it tends to go hand in hand with <em>accepting it as inevitable</em> (nearly always wrong). in the 1980s, a negotiator tackled a worker question, about &ldquo;transformation not happening soon enough&rdquo; by promptly asking &ldquo;what are <strong>you</strong> doing to bring about transformation?&rdquo;! These things are for all of us to do, in our own ways. We believe if someone has a better understanding of issues, s/he is better placed to deal with them, and less inclined to leave thenm to someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RESPONSE-ABILITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Working is a given. We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. There is a timetable, or diary, and s/he <em>responds</em> to that time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>")) ((? . 8) f post (u .

Our challenge going forward will be to make sure that the good habits enforced during lockdown will continue.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<h2 id=\"effective-parenting-programme\">\n <ins>Effective Parenting Programme</ins></h2>\n\n<p>The resumption of the Effective Parenting Programme will take place on the 18 May on the farms. We have all the necessary Health and Safety measures in place for the community workers. Parents will once again have access to the mobile toy library and the no-word books which our community workers have made during lockdown. We are mindful of how important it is to keep up the momentum for the first 1000 days and beyond, we cannot wait to get back to engaging with our mothers and toddlers. Our pregnant ladies have access to the HECT clinic for regular check-ups and all vaccines are available for babies, toddlers and children.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"clinic\">\n <ins>Clinic</ins></h2>\n\n<p>The clinic staff has screened the groups of shearers from town prior to commencing shearing on the farms at the beginning of May. They were given a thorough examination, Vitamin C and multivitamin supplements. We work through our Covid&ndash;19 farmers WhatsApp Group when planning the clinic day appointments with farmers. Chronic medication is picked up in town by our clinic sisters to prevent adults at risk having to stand in line at the town clinics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"food-parcels\">\n <ins>Food Parcels</ins></h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the 54 Karoo nomads, we are also assisting a further 8 families from town whose children attend our school. Some have had their salaries frozen as businesses wait to re-open, unfortunately others have been retrenched as businesses close down. The Hantam Community Education Trust assisted the HCI Foundation and eNCA Food Relief to distribute food parcels to 130 families at the Gariep Dam and Norvalspont. Our Financial Manager, Mary Ann Smith, was assisted by the Clinic sisters at Gariep Dam and Norvalspont with the distribution. It went very smoothly and a joy to help 130 destitute families.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"school\">\n <ins>School</ins></h2>\n\n<p>Lockdown is not easy for any of us, especially when trying to teach remotely in a rural area. We communicate with the parents via WhatsApp, each parent or learner has WhatsApp. We grouped the work according to the phases to make the work more accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Some parents are struggling to afford data and others are essential workers and their children only receive the work after the parents get home. Teachers are using videos to explain much of the work to the learners. They receive the work or activity and post the completed work directly to the teachers. The teacher provides a memo within two days and learners give feedback. Learners and parents can communicate directly with the teacher if they have a problem with the work. This has been working as well as can be expected given all the challenges. Teachers, parents and learners are very positive and cooperative toward the school and their work. [Report by Ms Landi Du Plessis HOD]</p>\n\n<p>The Hantam Trust is ready and waiting to start teaching at the school. We have the following Health and Safety measures in place:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>A digital thermometer, hand sanitizer and mask for the driver of each school vehicle [15 in total]\n  <br /></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Cloth masks for each child [245 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Hand sanitizers for each classroom [16 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>A high pressure sanitizer to clean the classrooms and vehicles [2 members of staff in charge of sanitation]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Full face shield masks for each teacher [15 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Soap and paper towels in all the Toilets</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The clinic sisters on standby.</p></li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"youth-development-programme\">\n <ins>Youth Development Programme</ins></h2>\n\n<p>Due to the Covid&ndash;19 pandemic, the tourism industry has shut down completely and we cannot place our students to complete their practical training. We have found a solution and have decided to create a Pop up Shop with frozen dishes that can be ordered and delivered. This will allow present students the opportunity to do their practical training in the Hantam Hospitality kitchen. Maryke, our training chef and her assistant Theo will supervise the following:</p>\n\n<p>• Proposed menu\n <br /> • Budget\n <br /> • Delivery\n <br /> • Advertising</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"proposed-menus\">\n <ins>Proposed Menus:</ins></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Soups</strong>:\n <br /> Hearty Beef &amp; Vegetable soup\n <br />Butternut soup</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chicken</strong>:\n <br /> Chicken roll filled with (bacon, spinach or Feta and Peppadew]\n <br />Butter chicken Chicken pie</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beef</strong>:\n <br /> Lasagne Stew with vegetables Bobotie Curry beef</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dessert</strong>:\n <br /> Malva pudding Baked chocolate pudding</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finances</strong>\n <br /> Capitec bank account – no bank costs. Make use of a cell phone for adverts, orders and payments. Make use of a Yoco machine, no cash will be handled.</p>\n\n<p>The students will be assisted with the costing of each dish and will build in a small profit so each student can earn a training stipend. Financial training will be part of their practical training.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deliveries</strong>:\n <br /> Two drivers will be responsible for all deliveries. Armed with masks and Sanitizers.</p>\n\n<p>Advertising will be done via the different WhatsApp groups in Colesberg, Noupoort.</p>\n\n<p>The HCET hospitality facilitator Estelle Jacobs had a meeting with Maritha Steyn from Steyn’s Culinary School on 1st May and to approve the above plan for a practical option for the students training. Ms Steyn agreed that this was a good way to prepare them for the industry and congratulated us on being so proactive.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your support on so many levels, this a time to stand together for a brighter future.</p>\n\n<p>We are very grateful.</p>\n\n<p>Keep safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hantam-community-education-trust-team\">\n <ins>HANTAM COMMUNITY EDUCATION TRUST TEAM</ins></h2>\n\n<p>   </p>")) ((? . 16) f post (u .

It has been said elsewhere in this blog that learners will eventually learn to prepare HTML documents. Word processors like Microsoft Word, Word Perfect (anyone remember that? It was better than Word by far, and version 5.1 was so good, it was used to typeset Toverberg Indaba) and LibreOffice Write will be quietly shoved aside, and learners will soon be asked to produce digital documents. It follows that soon after that, they will start to save these on web pages provided on a school server.</p>\n\n<p> In the postal economy, back in colonial days, the chief requirement for getting hired was good handwriting. Today, working nearly anywhere means working on a computer. Civil Servants still write exams for promotion. In handwriting days, some percentage of marks were given for good handwriting and presentation. Not too far down the road, their HTML presentation skills will be marked instead.</p>\n\n<p> At school, Instead of email attachments, URL links will allow the teachers to access work. Nice - no need to carry piles of paper home to mark - just access the school server.</p>\n\n<p> This elevates the importance of internet access, so some schools will need to up their game. Good. A lot has been said about creating &ldquo;good&rdquo; jobs for people, and system admins don&rsquo;t have to be programmers. Just keeping a server going is not that hard, it&rsquo;s only when looking after crucial databases comes into the picture that administration becomes very specialised.</p>\n\n<p> The South African government, soon after 1994, announced that it intended to use open source. Now and then, they still <strong>say</strong> it, but haven&rsquo;t <strong>done</strong> it. Every worker facing the public in any government office I have ever seen is working in Windows. All that money goes to Microsoft! Never mind, though, after Covid&ndash;19, as DM says, everything will change, and it will sink in that <strong>everything is going to the World Wide Web</strong>. If the government has any nous at all, it will put a lot of money into this easier level of IT management.</p>\n\n<p> This blog post is created in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,using%20a%20plain%20text%20editor.\"><strong>Markdown</strong></a>, a document formatting method that is very easy to learn. It is converted automatically to HTML by our blogging platform. School learners learn Markdown in a few mornings, and are comfortable with it within a week. Markdown converters are all over the web, and most programming languages have a library that can easily be imported to do the job. YouTube has many clips about Markdown.</p>\n\n<p> We think touch typing and Markdown is the way things will go, and that&rsquo;s why we started this challenge.</p>")) ((? . 17) f post (u .
