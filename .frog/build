We have all the necessary Health and Safety measures in place for the community workers. Parents will once again have access to the mobile toy library and the no-word books which our community workers have made during lockdown. We are mindful of how important it is to keep up the momentum for the first 1000 days and beyond, we cannot wait to get back to engaging with our mothers and toddlers. Our pregnant ladies have access to the HECT clinic for regular check-ups and all vaccines are available for babies, toddlers and children.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"clinic\">\n <ins>Clinic</ins></h2>\n\n<p>The clinic staff has screened the groups of shearers from town prior to commencing shearing on the farms at the beginning of May. They were given a thorough examination, Vitamin C and multivitamin supplements. We work through our Covid&ndash;19 farmers WhatsApp Group when planning the clinic day appointments with farmers. Chronic medication is picked up in town by our clinic sisters to prevent adults at risk having to stand in line at the town clinics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"food-parcels\">\n <ins>Food Parcels</ins></h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the 54 Karoo nomads, we are also assisting a further 8 families from town whose children attend our school. Some have had their salaries frozen as businesses wait to re-open, unfortunately others have been retrenched as businesses close down. The Hantam Community Education Trust assisted the HCI Foundation and eNCA Food Relief to distribute food parcels to 130 families at the Gariep Dam and Norvalspont. Our Financial Manager, Mary Ann Smith, was assisted by the Clinic sisters at Gariep Dam and Norvalspont with the distribution. It went very smoothly and a joy to help 130 destitute families.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"school\">\n <ins>School</ins></h2>\n\n<p>Lockdown is not easy for any of us, especially when trying to teach remotely in a rural area. We communicate with the parents via WhatsApp, each parent or learner has WhatsApp. We grouped the work according to the phases to make the work more accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Some parents are struggling to afford data and others are essential workers and their children only receive the work after the parents get home. Teachers are using videos to explain much of the work to the learners. They receive the work or activity and post the completed work directly to the teachers. The teacher provides a memo within two days and learners give feedback. Learners and parents can communicate directly with the teacher if they have a problem with the work. This has been working as well as can be expected given all the challenges. Teachers, parents and learners are very positive and cooperative toward the school and their work. [Report by Ms Landi Du Plessis HOD]</p>\n\n<p>The Hantam Trust is ready and waiting to start teaching at the school. We have the following Health and Safety measures in place:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>A digital thermometer, hand sanitizer and mask for the driver of each school vehicle [15 in total]\n  <br /></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Cloth masks for each child [245 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Hand sanitizers for each classroom [16 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>A high pressure sanitizer to clean the classrooms and vehicles [2 members of staff in charge of sanitation]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Full face shield masks for each teacher [15 in total]</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>Soap and paper towels in all the Toilets</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>The clinic sisters on standby.</p></li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"youth-development-programme\">\n <ins>Youth Development Programme</ins></h2>\n\n<p>Due to the Covid&ndash;19 pandemic, the tourism industry has shut down completely and we cannot place our students to complete their practical training. We have found a solution and have decided to create a Pop up Shop with frozen dishes that can be ordered and delivered. This will allow present students the opportunity to do their practical training in the Hantam Hospitality kitchen. Maryke, our training chef and her assistant Theo will supervise the following:</p>\n\n<p>• Proposed menu\n <br /> • Budget\n <br /> • Delivery\n <br /> • Advertising</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"proposed-menus\">\n <ins>Proposed Menus:</ins></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Soups</strong>:\n <br /> Hearty Beef &amp; Vegetable soup\n <br />Butternut soup</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chicken</strong>:\n <br /> Chicken roll filled with (bacon, spinach or Feta and Peppadew]\n <br />Butter chicken Chicken pie</p>\n\n<p><strong>Beef</strong>:\n <br /> Lasagne Stew with vegetables Bobotie Curry beef</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dessert</strong>:\n <br /> Malva pudding Baked chocolate pudding</p>\n\n<p><strong>Finances</strong>\n <br /> Capitec bank account – no bank costs. Make use of a cell phone for adverts, orders and payments. Make use of a Yoco machine, no cash will be handled.</p>\n\n<p>The students will be assisted with the costing of each dish and will build in a small profit so each student can earn a training stipend. Financial training will be part of their practical training.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deliveries</strong>:\n <br /> Two drivers will be responsible for all deliveries. Armed with masks and Sanitizers.</p>\n\n<p>Advertising will be done via the different WhatsApp groups in Colesberg, Noupoort.</p>\n\n<p>The HCET hospitality facilitator Estelle Jacobs had a meeting with Maritha Steyn from Steyn’s Culinary School on 1st May and to approve the above plan for a practical option for the students training. Ms Steyn agreed that this was a good way to prepare them for the industry and congratulated us on being so proactive.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your support on so many levels, this a time to stand together for a brighter future.</p>\n\n<p>We are very grateful.</p>\n\n<p>Keep safe.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hantam-community-education-trust-team\">\n <ins>HANTAM COMMUNITY EDUCATION TRUST TEAM</ins></h2>\n\n<p>   </p>")) ((? . 1) f post (u .

The three builders live on the Osler farm.</p>\n\n<p>The Trust Clinic is open on a Wednesday. This allows for all adults and children to be treated and medicated if ill. All the farmers have ordered digital thermometers and will take temperatures of farm workers and their families twice a day. There is a Hantam Covid&ndash;19 WhatsApp group with the Hantam farmers, clinic sisters and our local doctor. We have appointed a dedicated farmer’s wife to manage slot visitation time for each farm on the clinic day. The pharmacist at Noupoort orders the medicines for the clinic and the police drop it off with one of our clinic staff. The farm workers apprentice programme continues as all the apprentices live on the farms.</p>\n\n<p>We have a very vulnerable group in our community of beneficiaries, the Karoo nomad encampment. There are 54 men, women and children. The children’s meals at school are no longer available. Their only source of income is casual work, which has dried up. They live 50km from Colesberg, in lockdown. The Trust has to date undertaken the responsibility of ensuring that they have food, water and access to the clinic. Our project manager, who is also a member of Rotary, has worked very hard to secure funding from Rotary to drill a borehole on site for them, the nearest water point was 2.5 km away. A farmer offered his services and only charged for the diesel. The Hantam Trust assisted with the concrete slab and the mount for the hand pump and trough (for the dogs and donkeys) which has ensured clean water closer to the encampment.</p>\n\n<p>The hand pump is now connected and the water is flowing thanks to Rotary . Our Project manager has a special permit to bring out the clinic sisters each Wednesday, she uses this opportunity to deliver food and cleaning products to the Karoo nomads. We have received some emergency funding from Kinderfonds Mamas in the Netherlands which will enable us to provide this service until the end of June.
