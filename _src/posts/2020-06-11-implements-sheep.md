Ayabonga with sheep and implements, destined for his mother in Eastern Cape. 

Hanglip hosted several graduates since November 2018. Two are still with us. He and the other, Bongeka Duba, set off to the Transkei, taking some sheep sold to Ayabonga's mother, together with a pair of implements Hanglip will never again use. Bongeka will go on home from there.

The aim of the Dept of Agriculture's graduate programme, as outlined by Mr Ramafoko in de Aar before inception, is to respond to his request to them to "write your own book" on what they learn. Graduates from agricultural courses are hosted on farms (salaray paid by Dept) to gather experience enabling them to run such farming operations as current farmers move on.


This exchange of livestock and implements was unforeseeable in the beginning, but we think this sort of thing is a natural outcome of this government initiative, and look forward to trading like this going forward.
