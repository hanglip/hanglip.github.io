Starting on the 1st of March 2020, we want to restore old crop lands, consistent with the notion of Farm Within a Farm, or Core Farm.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>There are more than 20 of these older lands, fenced and lying fallow. To date we have come up with many ideas for restoration. The lands vary in size from 0.4 of a hectare up to several hectares. Over the years the Department of Agriculture suggested many ways to put these lands to use, recommending crops, ploughing and fertilizers in the old way. By contrast, as the years went by, our accountants urged us to steadily phase out crop planting, pointing us to a more streamlined operation. Now, the lands have lain fellow for many years.</p>\n\n<p>The main farm livestock operation will be leased out to others in about 2 years, giving us an opportunity to come up with new ways to restore the old crop plans to productivity.</p>\n\n<p>One example approach would be to rent a land to a graduate. With this model we would hope that the graduate would come up with some capital to place his or her own breeding livestock pair on such a piece of land. A breeding pair of pigs could result in 10 piglets for sale at the end of a summer, for example. If that is R10k worth of piglets, it should easily cover the cost of feeding with barley fodder grass and lucerne or hay, with a good profit for weaners. Hanglip could collect the rent and some share of expenses and some share of the profit, making it a win for everybody concerned. In the case of a graduate, we will also certify to the department that this particular graduate proved capable of small scale farming.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is only one of our ideas, so far. We need more ideas, and would like to extend an opportunity to everybody on the farm, including graduates. Another way could be to allow people to join the farm as associates, and participate in farming remotely from their homes and cities or towns nearby as a service. They invest, we do the work.</p>\n\n<p>We will listen and consider every suggestion. While doing so we will favour ideas that fall in line with certain general guidelines. These will include</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>complying with sustainable development goals</li>\n <li>minimal investment (we see no point in throwing a lot of money at anything at such a small scale)</li>\n <li>Avoiding petrol and diesel pollution</li>\n <li>Avoiding purchased fertiliser</li></ul>\n\n<p>The primary goal is to cool the earth down, create shade, using mulch to create our own fertility. We want to grow trees, shrubs &amp; palatable livestock fodder, with some cash crop row crops where possible, on some lands, while renting out others for small livestock (pigs, goats) operations.</p>\n\n<p>We also ask for opinions on things like <strong><em>marogo</em></strong> &amp; other wild greens, and invite observations on plants like <strong><em>spekboom</em></strong> &amp; any others observed to grow on Hanglip (meaning, are not killed by frost, maybe if planted in a certain way, or sheltered by other plants).</p>")) ((p+ #"C:\\Users\\jazper\\Sites\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2020-02-22-cecily-herbert-poem.md" . windows) f post (u .

Driving around Kat River, we left her birth farm, Amherst, and toured the outskirts of Lorraine, the &ldquo;main&rdquo; farm looked after by her father, Clarence Every. Amherst was the smaller, maybe less productive of the two farms.</p>\n\n<p>When the Apartheid government created the Ciskei and expropriated some Kat River farms, Lorraine was the prize that Ciskei leader Oupa Qoza grabbed for himself.</p>\n\n<p>Bongli, my Mom explained, was remembered as a hero of the 1918 Spanish Flu. With people coming down and expiring from the flu in the Kat River Valley, he saddled up, rode in to Fort Beaufort to ask for medicines, and retuned with vaccines. It was believed this action saved many lives in Kat River Valley, and Bongli was a hero for evermore.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like the stuff of heroism these days. However, Bongli, apart from his foresight, also had to buck some trends: he must surely have been under pressure to stick with local, tribal healers, and to avoid white doctors.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to assess now how well people related: Apartheid was such a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that many people don&rsquo;t know, for example, that there were middle class Africans, dressed in Victorian finery, some with cars, and many with farms and businesses, doing well, in those days. With Apartheid, that burgeoning middle class was lost to us. Perhaps, Bongli fournd himself with a doctor who thought he was &ldquo;cheeky&rdquo; to ask for medicine? I like to think not, and that the happy Hippocratic chappy gladly gave him the vaccines. Or maybe, Bongli&rsquo;s charm won the day.

In mid-summer, especially after rains, the reed has proved its value as a cattle feed. In one remembered recent case the reeds seemed to be the major ingredient in gains of an average of 2kg a day over a month onto a small group of hired weaner steers.</p>\n\n<p>1.2) There are sporadic willow and tamarisk (non-indigenous) and a few acacia trees along the river banks along the course of the stream down northwards.</p>\n\n<p>1.3) Along the reedbanks and along the stream there is abundant wildlife, including visitations from springbuck, ribbok, kudu (more recently), possibly eland, small buck etc.</p>\n\n<p>1.4) Predators and alledged predators. There are both warthogs and wild pigs. Tortoises. Porcupines, Rodents.Surrocates. Snakes. Jackals, Lynx. etc. Small game such as rabbits (including the endangered riverine rabbit).</p>\n\n<p>1.5) There also seems to be abundant birdlife, including many waterbirds.</p>\n\n<p>1.6) Undoubtedly a biodiversity area.</p>\n\n<p>1.7) The stream area seems to have stabilised through the state weirs, as an ecologically valuable wetlands area, a vulnerable biodiverse artery through the farm</p>\n\n<p>1.8) Apart from the occasional foray from stalker hunters, the only human use of the river areas, apart from farm grazings, has been as occasional hiking and walk areas, an occasional canoe area, an occasional camp area and occasional day picnic areas.</p>\n\n<p>2) The stream moves through River camp (200ha) both sides;</p>\n\n<p>2.1) then through the access to old lands areas above and below the Groothuis, and around the werf areas. The lands were used, as far as is known, for Lucerne and mielie plantings, for mainly cattle and horse feedings, and for dairy and pigs at certain times. Lucerne bales were stored in what is now the werf gebou, then in haystacks only.</p>\n\n<p>2.3) The IIQ consultants early on in the 1900’s advised to stop all irrigation on grounds of cuts and costs savings.</p>\n\n<p>2.4) The story of the old lands has been a static one for a long while.</p>\n\n<p>2.5) Quite probably re-issues of state permits for irrigation purposes etc.</p>\n\n<p>2.6) Overall the old lands have become barren areas, though used a great deal as convenient ‘sacrifice’ areas, because of closer proximity to the werf and working and shearing areas of the farm.</p>\n\n<p>2.6) In most recent times Jasper’s barley sprout trays pilot projects seem to have filled a need for feeds in and around the lands areas for horses, calves, milk cows, poultry… (cf Jasper’s plannings).</p>\n\n<p>3) The old lands, in order, include:</p>\n\n<p>3.1 Oorkantlande (est + 5ha), (from the small holding weir area eastwards, including old stone walls, a prominent old mulberry tree, flanking a deeply eroded area below two higher water drainage catchment mud-stone dams apparantly all for occasional irrigations into Oorkant and other old lands lower down; the Oorkant land was used exclusively for lucerne, until grass came in and took over:</p>\n\n<p>3.2) Potatoe lands upper and lower, fed from the contour water furrow from the old cement catchment dam above the windmill/;pump areas, fallow for many years, the lower land was flooded an is overgrown with Poplartree saplings and grass, plus is a storage area for old broken plastic tanks and pipes;</p>\n\n<p>3.3) Telefoonland, flanking the road, formerly a saltbush/general bush land;</p>\n\n<p>3.4) Upper saltbushlands to the Groothuis, including an old stone walled small catchment dam, bush (mainly gannabos), and used for many years to hold and house the calves for the milk cows in weekdays;</p>\n\n<p>3.5) The river flanking saltbush lands, formerly for Lucerne which drowned, grassed, used as a protection area for livestock during shearings, +- est 2ha;</p>\n\n<p>3.6) Up to roughly the Groothuis and its old coolroom and garden walls, are former mielie and lucerne lands (langmielie land, kort mielieland, skuur (shearing shed) mielieland). These are also old water-led lands, apparantly heavily compacted, fallow, with minimal growth (if any).</p>\n\n<p>3.7) The graveyard lands, +&ndash; 2ha, and to the roadside ‘richards land’ about 1 hectare, were also used for lucerne and/or maize as above from time to time; and as rest areas for horses and work areas for cattle, and as sheep shearing storage areas during shearings.</p>\n\n<p>3.8) The ribbok lands, about 2ha below the graveyard lands, and some 4 hectare in groot ribbok land down to the stream. Formerly ,Lucerne lands, Once for sainfoin plantings. For years now also fallow, apparently compacted, and used only for sporadic livestock holdings, including working horses and including sheep at shearings.</p>\n\n<p>4) Beyond the farm, opstal and oldlands areas, the stream moves alongside the western areas of Bergkamp, and through Karel Kamp, through sukkelwe camp, parts of Mulekamp, and lower Mulekamp to the lowest weir.</p>\n\n<p>4.1) There is a spectacular rock and cliff and hill area the stream flows through Karel kamp, sometimes risky for sheep drownings, but clearly potential for private secluded ‘housings/ accommodations etc’ .</p>\n\n<p>4.2) The lower tree-lined areas of the stream on the Hanglip side before the final weir, seems to be another high potential camp/picnic area.</p>")) ((p+ #"C:\\Users\\jazper\\Sites\\hanglip.github.io\\_src\\posts\\2020-02-28-associates.md" . windows) f post (u .
