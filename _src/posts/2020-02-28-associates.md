### DRAFT BAREBONES - SHARING PROJECTS WITH HANGLIP ASSOCIATES

## Approach 

<!-- more -->

1. SET different Associate involvement styles & levels  

    - Staff associates
    - Friend associates
    - Fanmily associates  

1. CONSIDER legal aspects for future protection iro the family Trust

    Need to:  
    
    - specify that renting land does not confer total freedom on renters
    - approve their MO when it comes to soil regeneration (or whatever)

1. OUTLINE scope or scale e.g. Limit to Old Land Restoration?

    - Associates may come with a viable business plan, (i.e. not soil regeneration) like profitable pig operation
    - or something else that suits us  

1. DESIGN Monitoring & Reward (If any)

    Consider how to:  

    -  measure progress
    -  reward for outstanding results

1. LIMIT Timeline (1 to 2 years) to end point (family Trust decides continuation Y/N?)

    - Initial preparation (Zai, or whatever), will be concentrated
    - after which maintenance is all that is needed  

1. Concerned solely with endeavours resulting in permanent trend/result within timeframe

    - Can we be open minded about other aims?
