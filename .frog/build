All the farmers have ordered digital thermometers and will take temperatures of farm workers and their families twice a day.

They live 50km from Colesberg, in lockdown. The Trust has to date undertaken the responsibility of ensuring that they have food, water and access to the clinic. Our project manager, who is also a member of Rotary, has worked very hard to secure funding from Rotary to drill a borehole on site for them, the nearest water point was 2.5 km away. A farmer offered his services and only charged for the diesel. The Hantam Trust assisted with the concrete slab and the mount for the hand pump and trough (for the dogs and donkeys) which has ensured clean water closer to the encampment.</p>\n\n<p>The hand pump is now connected and the water is flowing thanks to Rotary . Our Project manager has a special permit to bring out the clinic sisters each Wednesday, she uses this opportunity to deliver food and cleaning products to the Karoo nomads. We have received some emergency funding from Kinderfonds Mamas in the Netherlands which will enable us to provide this service until the end of June.

And they’re cravenly taking advantage of the fact that, for all the reasons that I just described, these are people that are politically invisible; they don’t have muscle. Many of them are domestic guest workers in the country; they signed paperwork that says they’re only here to work in fields, that’s all, and when they’re done, they return home. Or else they’re not documented, and so what are they going to do when they’re exploited? Sue? They have no standing, and so that’s being cravenly exploited.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We need a food system that is fungible, that has redundancy built in. The so-called efficiencies that have been built into the highly specialized industrial model that we have right now, we are now learning, do not serve us when you have a situation where a single thing that is unpredicted takes out one pillar of the food system, and then the whole thing comes crumbling down. That’s not the kind of food system that we need. We need one that is more distributed, meaning that there are more nodes within the food system that can respond in the volumes and quantities and the formats that are necessary for where people are going to be using this food.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Now, a very good example of that is that the farmers that are doing well right now are the so-called small-scale family farmers. These are folks that produce in volumes, and who redistribute in local and regional networks, where they can respond very quickly, to where the schools are now becoming redistribution points for SNAP, for instance, or for school food that needs to be picked up by students that otherwise might not have access to that food, because they’re not coming to school every day, and so on. Or through farmers markets, another very important redistribution method which is very fungible. So we’re learning that that’s actually what works; we need to invest more in these kinds of highly distributed systems, and less in the highly concentrated systems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Probably the single most influential agricultural lobby is the American Farm Bureau Federation. They say they represent farmers, but they actually represent agribusiness.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>And by the way, I’ll remind everyone that we’re living in a time where, to quote Noam Chomsky a couple of weeks ago, every fiscal conservative is hiding their copy of Ayn Rand and is lining up for benefits from the nanny state. There’s a lot of hypocrisy that we need to throw in these people’s faces, because that’s the urgency that the degree of exploitation and dysfunction that we’re living through demands.\"</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>We all have different takes on wages.

It is, for example, one of the problems with permacture: whereas a wool producer knows when s/he will shear, and more or less when and what s/he will be paid, there are few permaculture applications allowing predictable income. It is not <em>impossible</em> to plan, just rare to see permaculture entities that <em>do</em> &lsquo;plan for the bank&rsquo;.

Soon after that, he published earnings of all employed there, for all to see. It <em>did</em> narrow the wage gap, but having people swap roles and jobs for a time resulted in mutual respect. Floor sweepers notably did not in the slightest wish to ever attempt to understand upper management roles, (nor even covet their salary levels) after trying to perform in upper management!</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of decolonising, and as we enter 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) can we replace some tired old industrial words? What about using:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>\n  <p>doer</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>maker</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>chatter</p></li>\n <li>\n  <p>decider</p></li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>DOER (Do-er)</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is someone who does &lsquo;more of the same&rsquo; (and is arguably happy with that) daily. S/he is happy with learning new things from time to time, but unhappy with taking on too much complexity. It replaces wordls like &lsquo;labourer&rsquo;, &lsquo;worker&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MAKER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is someone who is also a doer, but tends to put something new into action. S/he is a creator but not necessarily a designer (only). It replaces a word like &lsquo;implementer&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CHATTER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a playful communicator, who prefers the world of ideas, and loves to juggle them and come up with solutions for (sometimes radical and/or new) things. S/he tends to move around a lot, and to ask &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;why&rdquo;. These people need to own and enjoy chatting and the value of lightness and play, instead of being guiltily glued to a desk &ldquo;looking busy&rdquo;! Chatter replaces &lsquo;communicator&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DECIDER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This a person happiest when s/he has to decide things. S/he has in the first place, the very precious skill of <strong>listening</strong> and the equally special skills of empathy, understanding and <strong>&ldquo;response-ability&rdquo;</strong>. Decider replaces &lsquo;manager&rsquo; and &lsquo;co-ordinator&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWARENESS, QUALITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>In all four of these positions, we feel it most important to foster and reward &ldquo;awareness&rdquo;. If people <em>understand</em> that there is poverty, and why and where it comes from, they have half a chance to help us free people from it. Being unaware of it tends to go hand in hand with <em>accepting it as inevitable</em> (nearly always wrong). in the 1980s, a negotiator tackled a worker question, about &ldquo;transformation not happening soon enough&rdquo; by promptly asking &ldquo;what are <strong>you</strong> doing to bring about transformation?&rdquo;! These things are for all of us to do, in our own ways. We believe if someone has a better understanding of issues, s/he is better placed to deal with them, and less inclined to leave thenm to someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RESPONSE-ABILITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Working is a given. We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. There is a timetable, or diary, and s/he <em>responds</em> to that time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>")) ((? . 9) f post (u .

England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were &ldquo;mysteriously&rdquo; unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out &ldquo;how many people&rdquo;, contributing &ldquo;how many pounds&rdquo;, for &ldquo;how many weeks&rdquo; from their wages, would take &ldquo;how long to pay cash for a house&rdquo;. The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every &ldquo;loan clubber&rdquo; at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Putting it another way, because of their &hellip; racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>This was at a time when &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to live next to one&rdquo; and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves &ldquo;able&rdquo; to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don&rsquo;t need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>In practice, what were the details? Let&rsquo;s say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That&rsquo;s 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That&rsquo;s slightly less than 8 years.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad.</p>\n\n<p>Bad luck, racist banks! The people got 400 houses without your loans! You should have been wide awake instead of lolling around &hellip; What? you were &lsquo;having a midlands&rsquo;? Too bad.
