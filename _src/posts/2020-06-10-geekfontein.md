You may wonder, is there a point to geeking away on a PC with something so tradition-bound as farming? Well, you were warned.

If you haven't yet, just Google "SpaceX Starlink". Elon Musk plans to clad the entire world in a shawl of low altitude satellites, beaming  cheap, fast-enough internet access to every koppie and cave on the globe. This means that the **Internet of 
Things (IoT)** will become a reality _everywhere_, so that given the right equipment (already long available to the connected world), we farmers can check the water level in a livestock drinking crib on the other side of a koppie kilometres away - on our phones. How great is that? It's appalling to think of a sheep dying of thirst, and failing water supply is a really good way for a farm to go belly up. 

With the phone app **what3words**, furthermore, we can direct someone to that crib, accurate to 3 metres. Even a complete newcomer to the area can locate anything (like rock art) using the same app. Just ... not without internet or cell reach. Jasper's daughter is a controller in emergeny services in Cambridgeshire, England, and that app is used by their emergency crews (it's world wide, too) to pinpoint emergencies phoned in by people. How often have you phoned in, stumped by exactly where you are in the world. "Erm, I'm - there's an intersection and a shop called 'Corner Shop'". With the app you give them three words and they know to within 3 metres where to find you, anywhere in the world.

Mr Musk is fairly impatient to get Starlink going, because for him it will be a $30Bn cash cow to supply money for his other space ventures. So, I would start preparing myself: agriculture has fared alright under the lockdown, but look at all the opportunities coming our way with these delelopments! It's not about replacing labour, it's about them applying special human talents to things that machines can't do. He is looking at Starlink happening by year-end in Trump-land and Canada, spreading elsewhere next year. 

Some previously unknown things are going on on farms all over the connected world. NZ and Oz farmers are using drones instead of sheepdogs to herd sheep. A drone mayt cost a bit, but "training' then is quick and cheap and training sheep dogs isn't cheap or quick. What will come along next? Sheep are being counted by drone apps! Unmanned carts take feed to livestock. Drones fly above crops taking infra-red images to pick up weak fertility and diseased patches.  

Even spreadsheets and word processing (may we call it *gasp* 'legacy computing'? We don't want to call it stone age) have their place still. There is little to beat a spreadsheet "what-if" comparing costs. We often need to establish if something we dream up is viable or not (it usuaslly isn't). We currently even use Excel as an _invoice creator_, though we are heading toward replacing this with a web app, so that we can raise, and send, invoices from our phones (OK, "there are apps for that" but we like D-I-Y, Because We Can. And, some of those apps cost money - and don't quite work how we want to. Whatever). 

Jasper was never really by way of an "enterprise programmer". Rather, a Q&D guy. "Quick and Dirty". Gets the job done, though he says it is seldom quick and usually quite clean! If any of our Associates wishes to share IT 'thangs', he is always interested.
