## ***W***ild ***I***deas: 

There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done a tractor-from-forklift EV conversion, please let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We **know** it's all over the net, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone's experience.

### The Landini repair/restore  question

For a long time, we haven't used tractors, at all. It's many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load. We are faced with a repair bill. 

What if, instead of a normal cylinder head repair, we replaced the diesal engine with an electric motor? We aren't sure this even **can** be done on the Landini, but we _hope_ that, out there we can find:

+ a forklift engine
+ a forklift battery
+ someone who has done this before.

We don't want something that can drive to town and back. We don't even ***need*** a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it.  If we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of the mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be **so** useful. However, we have constraints: we ...

+ are not in a hurry
+ won't throw money at this project.

Using the Landini for all trailer towing on the farm (i.e. every day) could be a massive saving. Even with the cost of periodic battery replacement over time, savings can be around R150 per day, or R33k per (220 working days) year.

We know that electric motors need almost no maintenance. In the South African Railways, in 1966, class E1 electric locomotives were just trickling in to the shops for their _first overhauls._ They had been in service ***since 1926 - forty years!***. There is a YouTube [ten-year review of a Nissan Leaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qPF11PmP8k). Nothing went wrong in the ten years of owning this car. Nothing broke! Assuming regenerative brakes, the brake pads surely lasted much longer.

So, if you know this has been done, and know the person that did it, or if you are knowledgable about such a conversion and feel you can give good advice as to what we need to shop for, please let us know. Even if we don't have time to do it now (we have a lot on our plate in the next year), it is still a worthwhile project going forward.

### Food Security

Everyone grows _something_ on the farm. We all have allotments. When we talk about food security, we really mean "for our animals", but that doesn't mean we can't do better for ourselves. Sprouted barley fodder has worked, on a tiny scale. We are trying to ramp that up before winter dries everything up.

### WEALTH CREATION

The simplest creation of wealth is a piggy bank. Setting aside a coin or two for a "rainy day" is fine when you have have a surplus of coins, but not easy when things are tight. All of us do this more easily together than we do singly. Surely, that is how a **stokvel** came about. Committing to save with others brings about the need to comply, to "not let anyone down". "Stokvels" (known in the West Indies as "loan clubs") are a good example of how much easier it is to save "together".

Story: In the factory of a large multinational corporationin Harlesden, London, a high percentage of the unskilled workforce were West Indies immigrants. As happens in immigrant situations, a few started out, and over time, pulled more and more of their countrymen and women into the firm. The immigrant population grew. Over years, some married, had children, and found the need to buy houses once they knew they would get permanent residence in England. 

There was a problem, however. England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were "mysteriously" unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out "how many people", contributing "how many pounds", for  "how many weeks" from their wages, would take "how long to pay cash for a house". The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every "loan clubber" at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash. 

Putting it another way, because of their ... racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden. 

This was at a time when "conservative" (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster "you don't have to live next to one" and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves "able" to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don't need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.

In practice, what were the details? Let's say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That's 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That's slightly less than 8 years.

So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad. Bad luck, racist banks! The people got 400 houses without your loans! You should have been wide awake instead of lolling around ... What? you were 'having a midlands'? Too bad.


Ricardo Salvador: 
>“Emancipation never really came to agriculture, in the sense that we still don’t pay the full value of the labor that’s required to make the entire system work.”

>There’s a phenomenon that all of us are observing at the moment that…. We could make this a political conversation, and I will try to steer away from that. But the fact is that policy is involved, and the phenomenon that I’m referring to is the phenomenon that’s known typically as the fog of war. When you have a major crisis that is absorbing the public’s attention, this is a prime time to try to push through policy goals that normally would just be completely intolerable, unpalatable, to the public.

>So what you have is the top of this pyramid that I described earlier, which is essentially the highly concentrated agribusiness sector, attempting to exploit the moment to cut as many costs as possible, and one of those costs is the cost of farm labor. And they’re cravenly taking advantage of the fact that, for all the reasons that I just described, these are people that are politically invisible; they don’t have muscle. Many of them are domestic guest workers in the country; they signed paperwork that says they’re only here to work in fields, that’s all, and when they’re done, they return home. Or else they’re not documented, and so what are they going to do when they’re exploited? Sue? They have no standing, and so that’s being cravenly exploited.

>We need a food system that is fungible, that has redundancy built in. The so-called efficiencies that have been built into the highly specialized industrial model that we have right now, we are now learning, do not serve us when you have a situation where a single thing that is unpredicted takes out one pillar of the food system, and then the whole thing comes crumbling down. That’s not the kind of food system that we need. We need one that is more distributed, meaning that there are more nodes within the food system that can respond in the volumes and quantities and the formats that are necessary for where people are going to be using this food.

>Now, a very good example of that is that the farmers that are doing well right now are the so-called small-scale family farmers. These are folks that produce in volumes, and who redistribute in local and regional networks, where they can respond very quickly, to where the schools are now becoming redistribution points for SNAP, for instance, or for school food that needs to be picked up by students that otherwise might not have access to that food, because they’re not coming to school every day, and so on. Or through farmers markets, another very important redistribution method which is very fungible. So we’re learning that that’s actually what works; we need to invest more in these kinds of highly distributed systems, and less in the highly concentrated systems.

>Probably the single most influential agricultural lobby is the American Farm Bureau Federation. They say they represent farmers, but they actually represent agribusiness.

>And by the way, I’ll remind everyone that we’re living in a time where, to quote Noam Chomsky a couple of weeks ago, every fiscal conservative is hiding their copy of Ayn Rand and is lining up for benefits from the nanny state. There’s a lot of hypocrisy that we need to throw in these people’s faces, because that’s the urgency that the degree of exploitation and dysfunction that we’re living through demands.

### TOVERSTOK

One way to create wealth is to simply hand on to infrastructre. For example, in Britain in the 60s, a report named the **check the name** report recommended closing down of branch lines. Only now, in the COVID-19 lockdown, is it realised thay many communities in England are terribly vulnerable in terms of supplies as a result of losing these lines. So much so, that the Briish government has budgeted **GPB 500 million** to open them up again. What a waste! It has been said "railways do not die. They are _closed down_.

It's now become obvious that only those countries with well developed rail networks have a hope of reducing emissions in time before the deadlines. Here in SA, 70% percent of all our goods is carried by road, which is four times more pollutive than rail. So, all things considered _only a return to rail_ can allow us to meet emission reduction targets. Nothing else. Even here, there of reopening or replacing what were once branch lines.

### Tech That Gets Left Behind

Steam is an utterly abandoned technology, no matter how good it can be. Take the steam locomotive, considered to be dead and buried due to efficiencies demanded by climate change. There are steam locomotives designed that are more climate friendly than diesel engines. 

Trouble is, nobody wants anything to do with steam any more. Why? Well, they see only soot, steam, water wastage and fire danger. 

However, the Closed Loop steam locomotive recondenses its steam (like our famous class 25 Condensing locomotives), the fire is enclosed, and its [design](https://www.climatecolab.org/contests/2016/transportation/c/proposal/1328901)

>**Implies that a 4,500 pound vehicle could get 145 miles to the gallon and reduce combustion gases, (pollution) by 90%**

Diesel fans, beat that. 

It's worth pointing out here that Jay Leno still has a (1925 Doble E-20) steam powered car. He had it tested, and it was found to be nearl within current emission constraints. Early steam cars took time to build up enough steam, but Doble's flash boiler got that down to 90 seconds: what it took until recently for a diesel turbo to spin up to speed.

Interestingly, this Closed Loop design can be developed for a paltry cost of only $25k (ok this is according to its inventor), and is

>'scalable' to any chassis from motorcycles and UltraLight Aircraft to Class 'A' over the road trucks and 12-42 seat passenger aircraft.

Combustive efficiency isn't always the sole criterion. For example, during apartheid, there was a call for return to steam power, because South Africa does not have oil. All of it was imported, and (especially under sanctions) this caused a vulnerability in terms of foreign exchange. We no longer have sanctions, but we still have foreign exchange vulnerability. Especially when we suffer from office bearers who wheel and deal to fill their own back pockets, to the point that one sold our entire nations's strategic stockpile of fuel in a day. Why? _Because S/he Could_. Despite this act of economic sabotage, s/he still walks free.

Well, we will never see this steam engine, no matter how efficient.  The world is moving to batteries, and our Elon Musk now claims his Tesla ones are good for two millions miles. Everything is going toward battery power.

## Birdsong

In Sebastian Faulks's book **Birdsong** set in WWI, he said that war was **"A huge crime against nature"**. Can anyone beat that for a description? Forest after forest was left without foliage, or even branches, on trees, and many trees were uprooted by shells. Millions of tons of sometimes poisonous munitions metal were buried in the forests and grasslands. It took more than half a century for some forests to recover, and recovery itself did not improve at a decent pace until, as one old man put it, "they managed to get the birds back".

One day, science will prove (his and) Jasper's theory: that trees grow well only with birdsong. Those growth rings in the tree trunks we cut down mark the passage of years, but they will also prove to be a vibrant record of the subtle seasonal bird songs themselves. Sound etches those rings, as it did the grooves in vinyl records!

With Covid-19 quietening the planet, scientists are finding out all sorts of things. One is that the earth’s crust, particularly sensitive to the movement of tectonic plates as well as our noisy vibrations, started to move less, allowing detectors to possibly [spot smaller earthquakes and volcanic activity.](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwHNMgFjWNvKwZsjJShTwDtcchP). Wars remain a crima against nature. It is good they are still noisy ... can you imagine anything more scary than a silent one? Like the 1918 Spanish Flu? After a four year bombardment, millions died sighing in their beds.

Our cities have filled with wild animals since lockdown. In some places, they show no fear of people. Mayabe it isn't **us** they shied away from, but our calamity of vehicle noise and poisoned air?

## COMPARISON BUILD: POLES vs FINNBUILDER

We will do a size for size comparison of the cheapest single room measuring (in metres):<br>
Height: 3<br>
Length: 5<br>
Width: 4<br>

The floor & roof will be identical, so we will confine ourselves to cost of walls only.
