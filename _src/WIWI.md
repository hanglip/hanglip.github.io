# Wild Ideas: the Landini repair  question

There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done what follows, pleaset let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We **know** it's all over the web, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone's experience.

For a long time, we haven't used tractors, at all. It's many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load.

So we think that there **must** be a forklift engine out there, and there **must** be some forklift batteries out there, and there **must** be someone out there who has converted a petrol or diesel tractor to electric, battery drive.

It is an ideal fit, because we don't something that kind drive to town and back. We don't even need a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it.  It won't fetech money in its current state: it we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be **so** useful. Understandably though, we have constraints: first, there is no hurry, and second, we don't have money to throw at this project.

Doing away with the need to buy diesel for it is a good thought! We could install a solar panel for trickle charging, and charge the batteries on the mains at night before use. 

There is nowhere on the farm that would result in a return trip of more than 20km, so that endurance, under load, is what we are looking at.
