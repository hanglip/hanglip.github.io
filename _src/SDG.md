# How Hanglip fares with Sustainable Development Goals:  



## End Poverty

We comply in terms of remuneration. The Dept is only interested in us meeting the National Minimum Wage, which we exceed. Maeder Osler developed a methodology around remuneration over the years, the aim (and result) being to reward and retain people who we admire and want to continue their work here.

## End Hunger

We aren't aware of anyone going hungry here. In spring, the farm provides seed, and most staff plant and cultivate a variety of vegetables in their allotments. Staff pay a nominal amount monthly for meat and milk allowances.

Our livestock don't go hungry either. We have not needed to feed animals during recent droughts. They find enough for their needs in the veld.  Closer to the homestead, we have good results growing sprouted barley. This has proved palatable to all but one of our hard working horses, and was taken hungrily by our laying chickens, geese, turkey and pigs.

As part of plans to regenerate worked out old croplands, we intend planting some fruit trees. Peaches grow well in Colesberg itself, but Hanglip's ecosystem is colder than the dorp, and not all trees survive the frosts. Our lowest recorded temperature in Winter 2019 was minus 14 degrees Celsius! Pehaps global warming may change this, so that in time, some trees will survive frost in the coming decades, or ... will there be _no frost_?

## Healthy Lives

Apart from assisting nutritionally as above, we are fortunate to be close to the Hantam Community Education Trust Clinic. During school terms, transport is provided for staff for health care on "clinic days".

## Education

As above, we are fortunate to be close to the Hantam Community Education Trust school.  In the current COVID-19 lockdown, plans are afoot to (as safely as possible) provide some "maths help" to pupils. 

Jasper has recycled an old tower PC into a "Linux Box", serving currently as a Typing Tutor. Our experience is that simply learning touch typing leads to greater computer literacy. People who can't type are easily frustrated on a PC.
