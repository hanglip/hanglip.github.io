# ANCIENT GRACE

I revere old, simple ways of doing things. As our mad “economic” drive for growth winds down, and the world discards the quest for profits for the rich few, we’ll find that we have time again for a lot that has fallen by the wayside in the past century of more.

This farm hosts ancient rock art. To look at them, and if one puts oneself into the artists’ skins, it’s plain they worked in a time and place without fear.  Even today, the finest available technique is unlikely to produce engravings with the grace, texture and line found on these Karoo rocks. Open to the sky as they are, there surely could have been no fear or uneasiness in their fashioning, no enemies lurking, no bosses.  The mandate was their own, just to make their image as true and beautiful as they could.

This is unknown to us today. There is always something to worry about, some concern or other, so complexity or “gotcha”, some pressure. We have no chance of emulating or replicating such grace unless the world changes greatly.
