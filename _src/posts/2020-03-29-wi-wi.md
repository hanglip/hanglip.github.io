We apply the term 'WI WI' to the ideas bounced around on the stoep, in vehicles, anywhere we get a moment to address the wonders of the world, and especially of the farming world.

For a while, we called it **WIskunde**, then **WIld Idea Society**, but the essential point is that WI stands for '**W**ild **I**deas'! 

What is there to life, if we can't bandy about a few ideas, toss a melt of old world and new tech into the mix?

For one example, we have discussed using a donkey cart (karretjie) for our work regenerating the worked out crop lands. After all, at no point is any old land more than 2km away: there is no hurry, so machines make now sense! Purchase price of one is probably a tenth of the price of a bakkie, and we don't depend on Kuwait for its fuel!
