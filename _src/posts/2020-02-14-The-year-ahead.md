#### WE HAVE A YEAR

We have a year or two: so, to be purposeful let's say 1 year. Starting on the 1st of March 2020, we want to restore old crop lands, consistent with the notion of Farm Within a Farm, or Core Farm.

<!-- more -->


There are more than 20 of these older lands, fenced and lying fallow. To date we have come up with many ideas for restoration. The lands vary in size from 0.4 of a hectare up to several hectares. Over the years the Department of Agriculture suggested many ways to put these lands to use, recommending crops, ploughing and fertilizers in the old way. By contrast, as the years went by, our accountants urged us to steadily phase out crop planting, pointing us to a more streamlined operation. Now, the lands have lain fellow for many years.

The main farm livestock operation will be leased out to others in about 2 years, giving us an opportunity to come up with new ways to restore the old crop plans to productivity.

One example approach would be to rent a land to a graduate. With this model we would hope that the graduate would come up with some capital to place his or her own breeding livestock pair on such a piece of land. A breeding pair of pigs could result in 10 piglets for sale at the end of a summer, for example. If that is R10k worth of piglets, it should easily cover the cost of feeding with barley fodder grass and lucerne or hay, with a good profit for weaners. Hanglip could collect the rent and some share of expenses and some share of the profit, making it a win for everybody concerned. In the case of a graduate, we will also certify to the department that this particular graduate proved capable of small scale farming.

However, this is only one of our ideas, so far. We need more ideas, and would like to extend an opportunity to everybody on the farm, including graduates. Another way could be to allow people to join the farm as associates,  and participate in farming remotely from their homes and cities or towns nearby as a service. They invest, we do the work.

We will listen and consider every suggestion. While doing so we will favour ideas that fall in line with certain general guidelines. These will include

- complying with sustainable development goals
- minimal investment (we see no point in throwing a lot of money at anything at such a small scale)
- Avoiding petrol and diesel pollution
- Avoiding purchased fertiliser

The primary goal is to cool the earth down, create shade, using mulch to create our own fertility. We want to grow trees, shrubs & palatable livestock fodder, with some cash crop row crops where possible, on some lands, while renting out others for small livestock (pigs, goats) operations.

We also ask for opinions on things like ***marogo*** & other wild greens, and invite observations on plants like ***spekboom*** & any others observed to grow on Hanglip (meaning, are not killed by frost, maybe if planted in a certain way, or sheltered by other plants).
