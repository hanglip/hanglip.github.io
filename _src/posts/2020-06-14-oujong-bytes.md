Wirth's Law:

>_**Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is becoming faster**_.

Say after me, quickly, **"Click-And-Beep"**. So, around 1984, I bought a **Kaypro II** computer. It ran under an operating system named **C/PM**. I thought it was fabulous, and there are things about it that I miss to this day. The "click" was the Kaypro II being switched on and the "beep" was it announcing it was ready to use. Yes, _that quickly_. Click (on), Beep (ready). It had:

+ an 8 bit CPU (Zilog Z80)
+ 64Kb RAM
+ the fastest, most precise keyboard action I have ever known.

The RAM, you read <ins>correctly</ins>. I had, yes, all of **65,536 bytes** (64Kb) to play with. The computer that got men to the moon had less than halft that. A woman named Margret Hamilton led the team writing the software that got them there. Your smartphone probably has a 64 bit data path (8 times wider), and 4 GB RAM, i.e. **32,768** times more RAM than my Kaypro II, and my Kaypro had more RAM than the computer that got men to the moon. And back. I emphasise "back" because Mrs Hamilton fixed a last-minute bug that would have left them stranded in space!

The Kaypro came with a bunch of 5 1/4 inch floppy disks, and a hefty pack of manuals. One **had** to read these manuals to have any hope at all of making the thing work. The supplied software suite was 'Perfect': _Perfect Calc_, _Perfect Writer_. I think there might have been Perfect-Other-Things too, I forget. Maybe a 'filer' (think: mickey mouse database). I typed a friend's document, (192 pages), onto (several 192 Kb) floppy disks, printed it all with a daisy-wheel printer. To change a font, the software would stop printing, print a message to the screen asking me to change the daisy wheel to the required font, and confirm. Printing took several all-nighters, so we were lucky we had no neighbours around. It sounded like AK47s going 24/7. 

Hey! That sounds like good rap ... **AK47**s going **<ins>24/7</ins> AK47**s going **<ins>24/7</ins> AK47**s going **<ins>24/7</ins>** ... ahem

Like many of my age, I cut my programming teeth on Borland **Turbo Pascal**. I ordered the (possibly the first in SA) C/PM copy of Version 1.0 from the USA. It had an unusually great manual, from which I taught myself to program in Pascal, helped by articles found in "Dr Dobbs Journal" at the library. I won't pretend it was easy, but it wasn't that difficult either. It _was_ a lot of work. Still, it turned out so worthwhile! Turbo Pascal compiled like lightning, and its programs ran like lightning too. 

Some years later, when the IBM PC came out, I sent for the DOS version of Turbo Pascal. It may by then have been version 3.0.  The IBM PC had ten times my Kaypro RAM at 640Kb, but it was much slower than my Karpro. I could do nothing on an IBM PC that I had not already got right on my Kaypro. Pascal also helped me to understand and get started with the C programming language, but I had to wait for some years before Borland Turbo C came out.

Only when WYSIWYG (_What You See Is What You Get_) word processors came along (that is to say, Apple and Microsoft ripped off Xerox, which Apple sued Microsoft for) did the market swing away from text (green or orange on black) displays with 25 rows of 80 char columns. They were replaced by fine grained displays emulating paper pages with fonts and all the bells and whistles: unusual characters, sub- and superscript and so on. I didn't enjoy it at first, because everything was now glacially slow where enerything had been instant. To this day, no newer PC has come out that can boot up, ready to go, in one second. Before SSDs came along, most 500GB or 1TB hard disks were booting Windows in a minute _at best_ (my XP took 5 minutes), and Linux distros in 45 seconds at best. I still long for those quick boots. Ok, I know there's huge amounts of RAM to test, and lots of other things, but I still long to switch on and get going. SSDs are a great difference.

With the new PCs and later, more particularly with the internet, came a **shabby industry malpractice**: rushing to criminally "GET VERSION ONE OUT" before the competition. Criminally, because Version One seldom worked. We had to await patches, and later, "updates" - internet downloads. I resented that. Paying for both a modem and internet connection was steep, and everything was slow. My first modem was 9600 baud. Even when we got to a 56K dial-up, I could make coffee while downloading an A4 page! And anyway, updates were not really that, they were were the "actual", completed software, in some state of readiness at last. 

That was fraudulent then, and is fraudulent now. Imagine if you were sold a car, and the salesment said, 

>"Erm, uh, listen, will you come back next week, please? Then, we can put your **real** engine in - what's in there now is a 70cc moped engine just to keep you going. You will get your V8 4-litre next week. We're assembling it **right now**. And, sorry, you'll have to pay for your own petrol to and from the re-fit, and we can't re-imburse you for your time.

What's the difference? Buggy software didn't put lives at risk? Tell that to air traffic controllers a few minutes away from New Years Eve, 1999, when your friendly software supplier's half-cocked rubbish would be keeping thousands of aircraft orbiting above airfields world-wide. At the stroke of midnight, those programs would no longer have a software clock, and would crash and burn along with the aircraft they were meant to control. Programmers all over the world had big paydays fixing that Y2k mess. But, we all still pay, for fraudulent, half-finished junk ... as I write this (June 2020), I find an article warning about Windows 10 updates, as often happens. THIS message:

>_Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\WORD.EXE'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again._

Poor, failing Windows 10 can't (_after an update_) locate the star of its show, **Word** ....

Given that they make most of their income from Office, you'd think they could have _tested_ this better. Or programmed it correctly from the start. They _have_ the money, don't they? I honestly can't understand why anyone pays for this rubbish, let alone allows themselves to be told that it is the "industy standard". I feel pity and shame faced with publishers who insist that authors submit their work in Word format. Most people can't imagine there was an alternative, but Apple and Linux "spoke" PostScript from their starts. **LaTeX** has been around for decades, and is still the preferred academic publishing tool in North America and Europe. Not only that, but the guy who wrote its TeX engine, Donald Knuth, actually **pays** people if they find a bug. He hasn'd paid for twenty years! No modern word processor software has to this day matched LaTeX type-setting.

Now you know why I am happy that there is such a thing as free and open source software. 

In answer to the original question "What **do** I like?", the answer is nothing much, any more. Nothing will, in the foreseeable future, go "Click-Beep" and let me work _immediately_. Down the line, I hope to compare two systems that **tend** (they are small and quick enough) to allow a return to early computing style. One is a small language named **PicoLisp**, and the other is a computing environment developed from Oberon programming language, named "**Black Box Component Pascal**". 

I need answers to the questions

+ are they quick and easy to start with and use?
+ can they do stuff we want to do **these days**?
