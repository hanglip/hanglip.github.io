My $50 investment in 1
984 cost R65 - the exchange rate was around R1.30 to the USD, and $50 then is worth $123.38 now. Adjusted against todayt's exchange rate, it amounts to R2137.78. 

Everything has changed. In 1984, almost nobody even knew about coding. There was no institutional money available to learn programming. One could pay a lot of money to study (COBOL only) at only one school of progamming in SA,  worth it because they guaranteed a job for successul trainees, enabling students to recoup their investments.

So, it is difficult arrive at an equivalent of Turbo Pascal today, either as a purchase investment, or as a coding workalike. Turbo Pascal cost money, was tiny, fast and compiled and ran like lightning. Python is a free download, typically does not compile (it's interpreted), and programs run slowly. However, they run **fast enough**, as everything does, today, The only free option back in my day was QBasic, which came free with DOS. It was slow, and horribly ugly to code in. Later, improved versions of "structured" BASIC arrived, none free. Python _syntax_ (the words that make up the language) is largely influenced by BASIC and Pascal.

Borland Turbo Pascal became Borland Pascal, and then Delphi. Today, there is a Community Edition of Delphi avaiable for **free**. Our education departments may have other concerns,though: Delphi needs at least a 1600 Hz CPU to run at all, where Python is also free, and runs fine on an 1100hz Pi (ARM) CPU. So there are cost implications when it comes to hardware. Python is what they, and everyone, everywhere, seem to want. Pascal, the learning language to beat them all, is now so _last century_. 

Further, edcutors are faced with a difficult task: things change all the time. Low end PCs are cheaper than low end tablets, but the big question is "where is programming going?". There is, and probably always will be, a shortage of enterprise programmers, so learning PC programming will never be a waste, and it's reasonable to think that educators should supply that coding market. In the last decade, 3D programming has emerged and become very big. Animation is everywhere, making it another stream of coding endeavour, different entirely from business programming, with much heavier hardware requirements. Python is one of the languages used for animation programming. Pascal and its descendants have been left behind in respect of 3D applications.

There is a futher new direction on the way - IoT - Internet of Things. Python is widely in use for that. So, is Pyhon the Turbo Pascal of today? 

It seems so.
