Came across this poem:  


    Everything changes. We plant  

    trees for those born later  

    but what’s happened has happened,  

    and poisons poured into the seas  

    cannot be drained out again.  

   

    What’s happened has happened.  

    Poisons poured into the seas  

    cannot be drained out again, but  

    everything changes. We plant  

    trees for those born later.  
   
  
   

Cecily Herbert.
