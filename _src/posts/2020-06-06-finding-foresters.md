    Title: Finding Foresters

A bosbouer (forester) once pointed out to me that his chosen career demanded that he:

+ plant forests that would outlive him
+ look after forests that had been planted before he was born
+ would not (ever) harvest forests that he had planted.

There is no egoism in this scenario. Every tiny thing one does is credited to previous and future generations. 

Greta Thunberg and others claim that we have landed them in a climate change predicament. She is famous for this, and probably the first of thousands to come. What isn't publicised as much is what to do about it, in a positive sense. By positive sense, meaning "don't tell us what **not** to do, tell us what **to** do". 

Looking back at South African history purely as a forester is a lesson in how to avoid what Thunberg levels at us. Practically every Zulu male, once the wars were in the past, became a sawyer. Even in the Great Depression, there were enough indigenous forests left that my father could find work, stripped to the waist, felling trees alongside Zulus. He didn't enjoy talkiing about it, thinking it demeaned him. 

There is no talk or re-planting what was cut down. Perhaps that came later, and what was planted was almost exclusively for mine props, to serve the industrial model of that time. Massive plantations of these trees plunged South Africa into helpless drought - just look at Makana. Removal of gum trees surrounding the town healed the water table within a year, and all the creeks and streams began to flow again. 

Mine magnates have never given a fig for farmers or agriculture.
