All the farmers have ordered digital thermometers and will take temperatures of farm workers and their families twice a day. There is a Hantam Covid&ndash;19 WhatsApp group with the Hantam farmers, clinic sisters and our local doctor. We have appointed a dedicated farmer’s wife to manage slot visitation time for each farm on the clinic day.

The farm workers apprentice programme continues as all the apprentices live on the farms.</p>\n\n<p>We have a very vulnerable group in our community of beneficiaries, the Karoo nomad encampment. There are 54 men, women and children. The children’s meals at school are no longer available. Their only source of income is casual work, which has dried up. They live 50km from Colesberg, in lockdown. The Trust has to date undertaken the responsibility of ensuring that they have food, water and access to the clinic. Our project manager, who is also a member of Rotary, has worked very hard to secure funding from Rotary to drill a borehole on site for them, the nearest water point was 2.5 km away. A farmer offered his services and only charged for the diesel. The Hantam Trust assisted with the concrete slab and the mount for the hand pump and trough (for the dogs and donkeys) which has ensured clean water closer to the encampment.</p>\n\n<p>The hand pump is now connected and the water is flowing thanks to Rotary . Our Project manager has a special permit to bring out the clinic sisters each Wednesday, she uses this opportunity to deliver food and cleaning products to the Karoo nomads. We have received some emergency funding from Kinderfonds Mamas in the Netherlands which will enable us to provide this service until the end of June.

These people need to own and enjoy chatting and the value of lightness and play, instead of being guiltily glued to a desk &ldquo;looking busy&rdquo;! Chatter replaces &lsquo;communicator&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DECIDER</strong></p>\n\n<p>This a person happiest when s/he has to decide things. S/he has in the first place, the very precious skill of <strong>listening</strong> and the equally special skills of empathy, understanding and <strong>&ldquo;response-ability&rdquo;</strong>. Decider replaces &lsquo;manager&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>AWARENESS, QUALITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>In all four of these positions, we consider it most important to foster and reward &ldquo;awareness&rdquo;. If people <em>understand</em> that there is poverty, and why and where it comes from, they have half a chance to help us free our people from it. Being unaware of it tends to go hand in hand with <em>accepting it as inevitable</em> (nearly always wrong). in the 1980s, a negotiator tackled the a worker question, about &ldquo;transformation not happening soon enough&rdquo; by promptly asked what he, the questioner, was doing to bring about transformation! These things are for all of us to do, in our own ways, so we believe if someone has a better understanding of issues, s/he is better placed to deal with it, and less inclined to leave it to someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RESPONSE-ABILITY</strong></p>\n\n<p>Working is a given. We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. S/he <em>responds</em> to the time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness, of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>")) ((? . 3) f post (u .
