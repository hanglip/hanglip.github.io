## A mind/memory walk down the riversides:

From South to north.

A) General:

1) The stream comes into a narrow neck of eroded and fenced off land between Poortjiefarm and Hanglip in the East,  and an island of land flanking Poortjie farm in the West, and between a tributary from Poortjie/Klein Poortjie farms.

<!-- more -->

1.1) There are fluitjiesriet plants along both banks, as in most of the stream through the farm. In mid-summer, especially after rains, the reed has proved its value as a  cattle feed. In one remembered recent case the reeds seemed to be the major ingredient in gains of an average of 2kg a day over a month onto a small group of hired weaner steers.

1.2) There are sporadic  willow and tamarisk (non-indigenous) and  a few acacia trees along the river banks along the course of the stream down northwards.

1.3) Along the reedbanks and along the stream there is abundant wildlife, including visitations from springbuck, ribbok, kudu (more recently), possibly eland, small buck etc.

1.4) Predators and alledged predators. There are both warthogs and wild pigs. Tortoises. Porcupines, Rodents.Surrocates. Snakes. Jackals, Lynx. etc. Small game such as rabbits (including the endangered riverine rabbit).

1.5) There also seems to be abundant birdlife, including many waterbirds.

1.6) Undoubtedly a biodiversity area.

1.7) The stream area seems to have stabilised through the state weirs, as an ecologically valuable wetlands area,  a vulnerable biodiverse artery through the farm

1.8) Apart from the occasional foray from stalker hunters, the only human use of the river areas, apart from farm grazings, has been as occasional hiking and walk areas, an occasional  canoe area, an occasional camp area and occasional day picnic areas.  

2) The stream moves through River camp (200ha) both sides;

2.1) then through the access to old lands areas above and below the Groothuis, and around the werf areas. The lands were used, as far as is known, for Lucerne and mielie plantings, for mainly cattle and horse feedings, and for dairy and pigs at  certain times. Lucerne bales were stored in what is now the werf gebou, then  in haystacks only.

2.3) The IIQ consultants early on in the 1900’s advised to stop all irrigation on grounds of cuts and costs savings.

2.4) The story of the old lands has been a static one for a long while.

2.5) Quite probably re-issues of state permits for irrigation purposes etc.

2.6) Overall the old lands have become barren areas, though used a great deal as convenient ‘sacrifice’ areas, because of closer proximity to the werf and working and shearing areas of the farm.

2.6) In most recent times Jasper’s  barley sprout trays pilot projects seem to have filled a need for feeds in and around the lands areas for horses, calves, milk cows, poultry… (cf Jasper’s plannings).  

3) The old lands, in order, include:

3.1 Oorkantlande (est + 5ha), (from the small holding weir area eastwards, including old stone walls, a prominent old mulberry tree, flanking a deeply eroded area below two higher water drainage catchment mud-stone dams apparantly all for occasional irrigations into Oorkant and other old lands lower down; the Oorkant land was used exclusively for lucerne, until grass  came in and took over:

3.2) Potatoe lands upper and lower, fed from  the contour water furrow from the old cement catchment dam above the windmill/;pump areas, fallow for many years, the lower land was flooded an is overgrown with Poplartree saplings and grass, plus is a storage area for old broken plastic tanks and pipes;

3.3) Telefoonland, flanking the road, formerly a saltbush/general bush land;

3.4) Upper saltbushlands to the Groothuis, including an old stone walled small catchment dam, bush (mainly gannabos), and used for many years to hold and house the calves for the milk cows in weekdays;

3.5) The river flanking saltbush lands, formerly for Lucerne which drowned, grassed, used as a protection area for livestock during shearings, +- est 2ha;

3.6) Up to roughly the Groothuis and its old coolroom and garden walls, are former mielie and lucerne lands (langmielie land, kort mielieland,  skuur (shearing shed) mielieland). These are also old water-led lands, apparantly heavily compacted, fallow, with minimal growth (if any).

3.7) The graveyard lands, +- 2ha, and to the roadside ‘richards land’ about 1 hectare, were also used for lucerne and/or maize as above from time to time; and as rest areas for horses and work areas for cattle, and as sheep shearing storage areas during shearings.

3.8) The ribbok lands, about 2ha below the graveyard lands, and some 4 hectare in groot ribbok land down to the stream. Formerly ,Lucerne lands, Once for sainfoin plantings. For years now also fallow, apparently compacted, and  used only for sporadic livestock holdings, including working horses and including sheep at shearings.   

4) Beyond the farm, opstal and oldlands areas, the stream moves alongside the western areas of Bergkamp, and through Karel Kamp, through sukkelwe camp,  parts  of Mulekamp, and lower Mulekamp to the lowest weir.

4.1) There is a spectacular rock and cliff and hill area the stream flows through Karel kamp, sometimes risky for sheep drownings,  but clearly potential for private secluded ‘housings/ accommodations etc’ .

4.2) The lower tree-lined areas of the stream on the Hanglip side before the final weir, seems to be another high potential  camp/picnic area.
