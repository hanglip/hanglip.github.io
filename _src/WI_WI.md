## ***W***ild ***I***deas: 

There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done what follows, pleaset let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We **know** it's all over the net, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone's experience.

### The Landini repair/restore  question

For a long time, we haven't used tractors, at all. It's many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load. We are faced with a quote of R40k for the repair.

We aren't sure this even **can** be done on the Landini, but we hope that there **must** be a forklift engine out there, and there **must** be some forklift batteries out there, and there **must** be someone out there who has converted a petrol or diesel tractor to electric, battery drive.

We don't want something that can drive to town and back. We don't even ***need*** a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it.  It won't fetch money in its current state: if we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of the mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be **so** useful. However, we have constraints:

+ there is no hurry
+ we don't have money to throw at this project.

Doing away with the need to buy diesel for it is a good thought! At six litres per hour, at R15 per litre and only 20 hours usage per annum, fuel will cost **R1800** p.a. at current prices, and who knows how much, given that diesel price will rise again after COVID-19? 

Then, there is the maintenance factor. We know that electric motors need almost no maintenance. In the South African Railways, in 1966, class E1 electric locomotives were just trickling in to the shops for their **first overhauls.** They had been in service ***since 1926 - forty years!***. There is a ten-year review of a Nissan Leaf on the internet right now. Aside from the owner's other issues (almost none), nothing went wrong in the ten years of owning this car. Nothing broke. He fixed two punctures!

With a diesel engine we can't be sure it won't be back in for repairs within a week of its latest overhaul.

We could install a solar panel for trickle charging, and charge the batteries from the mains at night before use. At current prices, charging costs are less than R2 per hour, or R24 per day. At 20 days usage, this adds up to R480 - **R1320 less** than diesel over the same period. Naturally, we are not sure of these figures, and invite anyone in the know to correct them.

There is nowhere on the farm that would result in a return trip of more than 20km, so that endurance, under load, is all that we will need. We think! 

So, if you know this has been done, and know the person that did it, please let us know. Or, if you are knowledgable about such a conversion and feel you can give good advice as to what we need to shop for, and what the result will be like, please let us know. Even if we don't have time to do it now (we have a lot on our plate in the next year), it is still a worthwhile project going forward.
