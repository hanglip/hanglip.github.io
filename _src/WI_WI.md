## ***W***ild ***I***deas: 

There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done a tractor-from-forklift EV conversion, please let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We **know** it's all over the net, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone's experience.

### The Landini repair/restore  question

For a long time, we haven't used tractors, at all. It's many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load. We are faced with a repair bill. 

What if, instead of a normal cylinder head repair, we replaced the diesal engine with an electric motor? We aren't sure this even **can** be done on the Landini, but we _hope_ that, out there we can find:

+ a forklift engine
+ a forklift battery
+ someone who has done this before.

We don't want something that can drive to town and back. We don't even ***need*** a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it.  If we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of the mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be **so** useful. However, we have constraints: we ...

+ are not in a hurry
+ won't throw money at this project.

Using the Landini for all trailer towing on the farm (i.e. every day) could be a massive saving. Even with the cost of periodic battery replacement over time, savings can be around R150 per day, or R33k per (220 working days) year.

We know that electric motors need almost no maintenance. In the South African Railways, in 1966, class E1 electric locomotives were just trickling in to the shops for their _first overhauls._ They had been in service ***since 1926 - forty years!***. There is a YouTube [ten-year review of a Nissan Leaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qPF11PmP8k). Nothing went wrong in the ten years of owning this car. Nothing broke! Assuming regenerative brakes, the brake pads surely lasted much longer.

So, if you know this has been done, and know the person that did it, or if you are knowledgable about such a conversion and feel you can give good advice as to what we need to shop for, please let us know. Even if we don't have time to do it now (we have a lot on our plate in the next year), it is still a worthwhile project going forward.

### Food Security

Everyone grows _something_ on the farm. We all have allotments. When we talk about food security, we really mean "for our animals", but that doesn't mean we can't do better for ourselves. Sprouted barley fodder has worked, on a tiny scale. We are trying to ramp that up before winter dries everything up.

### TOVERSTOK

One way to create wealth is to simply hand on to infrastructre. For example, in Britain in the 60s, a report named the **check the name** report recommended closing down of branch lines. Only now, in the COVID-19 lockdown, is it realised thay many communities in England are terribly vulnerable in terms of supplies as a result of losing these lines. So much so, that the Briish government has budgeted **GPB 500 million** to open them up again. What a waste! It has been said "railways do not die. They are _closed down_.

It's now become obvious that only those countries with well developed rail networks have a hope of reducing emissions in time before the deadlines. Here in SA, 70% percent of all our goods is carried by road, which is four times more pollutive than rail. So, all things considered _only a return to rail_ can allow us to meet emission reduction targets. Nothing else. Even here, there of reopening or replacing what were once branch lines.

### Tech That Gets Left Behind

Steam is an utterly abandoned technology, no matter how good it can be. Take the steam locomotive, considered to be dead and buried due to efficiencies demanded by climate change. There are steam locomotives designed that are more climate friendly than diesel engines. 

Trouble is, nobody wants anything to do with steam any more. Why? Well, they see only soot, steam, water wastage and fire danger. 

However, the Closed Loop steam locomotive recondenses its steam (like our famous class 25 Condensing locomotives), the fire is enclosed, and its [design](https://www.climatecolab.org/contests/2016/transportation/c/proposal/1328901)

>**Implies that a 4,500 pound vehicle could get 145 miles to the gallon and reduce combustion gases, (pollution) by 90%**

Diesel fans, beat that. 

It's worth pointing out here that Jay Leno still has a (1925 Doble E-20) steam powered car. He had it tested, and it was found to be nearl within current emission constraints. Early steam cars took time to build up enough steam, but Doble's flash boiler got that down to 90 seconds: what it took until recently for a diesel turbo to spin up to speed.

Interestingly, this Closed Loop design can be developed for a paltry cost of only $25k (ok this is according to its inventor), and is

>'scalable' to any chassis from motorcycles and UltraLight Aircraft to Class 'A' over the road trucks and 12-42 seat passenger aircraft.

Combustive efficiency isn't always the sole criterion. For example, during apartheid, there was a call for return to steam power, because South Africa does not have oil. All of it was imported, and (especially under sanctions) this caused a vulnerability in terms of foreign exchange. We no longer have sanctions, but we still have foreign exchange vulnerability. Especially when we suffer from office bearers who wheel and deal to fill their own back pockets, to the point that one sold our entire nations's strategic stockpile of fuel in a day. Why? _Because S/he Could_. Despite this act of economic sabotage, s/he still walks free.

Well, we will never see this steam engine, no matter how efficient.  The world is moving to batteries, and our Elon Musk now claims his Tesla ones are good for two millions miles. Everything is going toward battery power.

We will do a size for size comparison of the cheapest single room measuring (in metres):<br>

The floor & roof will be identical, so we will confine ourselves to cost of walls only.
