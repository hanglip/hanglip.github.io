<h2 id="wild-ideas"><strong><em>W</em></strong>ild <strong><em>I</em></strong>deas:</h2>

<p>There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done what follows, pleaset let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We <strong>know</strong> it&rsquo;s all over the net, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p><a name="landini"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-landini-repairrestore-question">The Landini repair/restore question</h3>

<p>For a long time, we haven&rsquo;t used tractors, at all. It&rsquo;s many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load. We are faced with a repair bill.</p>

<p>What if, instead of a normal cylinder head repair, we replaced the diesal engine with an electric motor? We aren&rsquo;t sure this even <strong>can</strong> be done on the Landini, but we <em>hope</em> that, out there we can find:</p>

<ul>
 <li>a forklift engine</li>
 <li>a forklift battery</li>
 <li>someone who has done this before.</li></ul>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want something that can drive to town and back. We don&rsquo;t even <strong><em>need</em></strong> a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it. If we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of the mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be <strong>so</strong> useful. However, we have constraints: we &hellip;</p>

<ul>
 <li>are not in a hurry</li>
 <li>won&rsquo;t throw money at this project.</li></ul>

<p>Using the Landini for all trailer towing on the farm (i.e. every day) could be a massive saving. Even with the cost of periodic battery replacement over time, savings can be around R150 per day, or R33k per (220 working days) year.</p>

<p>We know that electric motors need almost no maintenance. In the South African Railways, in 1966, class E1 electric locomotives were just trickling in to the shops for their <em>first overhauls.</em> They had been in service <strong><em>since 1926 - forty years!</em></strong>. There is a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qPF11PmP8k">ten-year review of a Nissan Leaf</a>. Nothing went wrong in the ten years of owning this car. Nothing broke! Assuming regenerative brakes, the brake pads surely lasted much longer.</p>

<p>So, if you know this has been done, and know the person that did it, or if you are knowledgable about such a conversion and feel you can give good advice as to what we need to shop for, please let us know. Even if we don&rsquo;t have time to do it now (we have a lot on our plate in the next year), it is still a worthwhile project going forward.</p>

<p><a name="waterlesstoilet"></a></p>

<h3 id="waterless-toilets">Waterless Toilets</h3>

<p>Chemical toilets are possible: most are not too bulky, but we are left with a chemical disposal problem: the effluent must be disposed of at <em>disposal points</em>, meaning that we would need to take smelly, chemical effluent to the dorp. Even if Colesberg <em>has</em> such a disposal point, we are not considering this, preferring to somewhow work with nature.</p>

<p>We looked long and hard at retrofitting our buildings with composting toilets, concluding it is too difficult: too much bashing down of walls, excavating concrete, digging floors. We need to look at something else.</p>

<p>The problem with our longstanding flush toilets is that we <em>use</em> good water in the first place, and then we <em>pollute</em> it in the second place. Since we can&rsquo;t easily replace our flush toilets, in what way can we reduce their disadvantages? Using grey water for the toilets can help, but that means retrofitting the plumbing &hellip;</p>

<p>We must work out how to return it to the water table in pristine, or at least good, condition, something that septics don&rsquo;t achieve. One way may be leading effluent through reed beds. Our Oorlogspoort stream is lined with <em>fluitjiesriet</em>. We suspect that, like most reeds, it has a huge appetite for water impurities. We are looking to lead a trickle of water down a slight incline in an old cropland, through a half-hectare zigzag maze of reeds, returning clean water to the stream or a pond.</p>

<p>Our plans for the riverine area include buiding a deck for campers. Under the deck will be mesh enclosing equipment storage. We may erect a tent on the deck, and build a waterless toilet close by. We are looking at making our own biochar for that toilet.</p>

<p><a name="foodsecurity"></a></p>

<h2 id="food-security">Food Security</h2>

<p>Everyone grows <em>something</em> on the farm. We all have allotments. When we talk about food security, we really mean &ldquo;for our animals&rdquo;, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t do better for ourselves. Sprouted barley fodder has worked, on a tiny scale. We are trying to ramp that up before winter dries everything up.</p>

<p><a name="laboursemantics"></a></p>

<h2 id="do-or-give-worker-semantics">DO or GIVE: &ldquo;WORKER&rdquo; SEMANTICS</h2>

<p>We get our word &ldquo;do&rdquo; from Latin. I was taught that it meant &ldquo;give&rdquo; - as in <strong>DO</strong>nate, whereas it has strayed through centuries in English to mean the opposite of idleness. I prefer to think of it as meaning both &ldquo;do&rdquo; and &ldquo;give&rdquo;. When I work for somebody, it feels better to know I am &ldquo;giving&rdquo; my employer something, rather than merely killing time. Just as surely, when idle, I can&rsquo;t be giving at all. That said, idleness has its place. Bertrand Russell wrote <strong>In Praise of Idleness</strong>, though I don&rsquo;t recall him advocating a salary for idlers!</p>

<p>In the same way, the words that came into our language courtesy of the Industrial Revolution are growing boring tiring. Take &ldquo;manager&rdquo;. The root is also from Latin: &ldquo;manus&rdquo; is a hand, and I suppose we must believe that managers &ldquo;handle&rdquo; things. In my mind, they &ldquo;manipulate&rdquo; rather than handle! Their task became to wheedle ever more work out of people, calling this &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;. If ever a word needed to be &ldquo;decolonialised&rdquo; it is that one!</p>

<p>For a long time, managers came from the ranks - they had proved themselves on the job. That ddn&rsquo;t always make them good managers (see Dr Laurence J Peter, <strong>The Peter Principle</strong>). However, back then, they were more effective than now in one sense: they were not asking others to do something they themselves could not do. Some respect naturally followed.</p>

<p>When managers were no longer expected to perform what they expected from others, but rather &ldquo;specialise&rdquo; in management, respect was lost and it all began to unravel. It is difficult to respect someone who can&rsquo;t do what s/he is asking you to do.</p>

<p>Ricardo Semler (<strong>Maverick, Seven Day Weekend</strong>) Brazilian industrialist famously fired 95% of management within his first month of taking over his father&rsquo;s heavy industry factory. Soon after that, he published earnings of all employed there, for all to see. It <em>did</em> narrow the wage gap, but having people swap roles and jobs for a time resulted in mutual respect for everyone in their own roles. Floor sweepers notably did not in the slightest wish to ever attempt to understand upper management roles, (nor even covet their salary levels) after trying to upper management!</p>

<p>For the sake of decolonising, and as we enter 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) can we replace some tired old industrial words? What about:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>doer</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>maker</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>chatter</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>decider</p></li></ul>

<h3 id="doer">DOER</h3>

<p>This is someone who does &lsquo;more of the same&rsquo; (and is arguably happy with that) daily. S/he is happy with learning new things from time to time, but unhappy with taking on too much complexity too soon. It replaces wordls like &lsquo;labourer&rsquo;, &lsquo;worker&rsquo;.</p>

<h3 id="maker">MAKER</h3>

<p>This is someone who is also a doer, but tends to put something new into action. S/he is a creator but not necessarily a designer (only). It replaces a word like &lsquo;implementer&rsquo;.</p>

<h3 id="chatter">CHATTER</h3>

<p>This is a playful communicator, who prefers the world of ideas, and loves to juggle them about and come up with solutions for things, even something radically new. S/he tends to move around a lot, and to ask &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;why&rdquo;. These people need to own and enjoy chatting and the value of lightness and play, instead of being guiltily glued to a desk &ldquo;looking busy&rdquo;! Chatter replaces &lsquo;communicator&rsquo;.</p>

<h3 id="decider">DECIDER</h3>

<p>This a person happiest when s/he has to decide things. S/he has in the first place, the very precious skill of <strong>listening</strong> and the equally special skills of empathy, understanding and <strong>&ldquo;response-ability&rdquo;</strong>. Decider replaces &lsquo;manager&rsquo;.</p>

<h3 id="awareness-and-quality">Awareness and Quality</h3>

<p>In all four of these positions, we consider it most important to foster and reward &ldquo;awareness&rdquo;. If people <em>understand</em> that there is poverty, and why and where it comes from, they have half a chance to help us free our people from it. Being unaware of it tends to go hand in hand with <em>accepting it as inevitable</em> (nearly always wrong). in the 1980s, a negotiator tackled the a worker question, about &ldquo;transformation not happening soon enough&rdquo; by promptly asked what he, the questioner, was doing to bring about transformation! These things are for all of us to do, in our own ways, so we believe if someone has a better understanding of issues, s/he is better placed to deal with it, and less inclined to leave it to someone else.</p>

<h2 id="response-ability">RESPONSE-ABILITY</h2>

<p>Working is a given. We find everyone gets down to it with a will, so we prefer to see a person as a <strong>responder</strong>. S/he <em>responds</em> to the time of day. For example, our cows are milked first thing in the morning, before we get into the veld or whatever. So, we resond to that time of the day by milking (just as our response to 10h30 is to have tea!). It follows that it is just as easy to reward people for <em>whom they are</em> as for <em>what they do</em>.</p>

<p>Maeder has evolved over the years a <strong>Discretionary Award</strong> system against which people are rewarded for quality as well as quantity. They are rewarded for awareness, of issues, for their specialness and their special accomplishments, in place of a dull count of tasks ticked off.</p>

<p><a name="wealthcreation"></a></p>

<h2 id="wealth-creation">WEALTH CREATION</h2>

<p>The simplest creation of wealth is a piggy bank. Setting aside a coin or two for a &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo; is fine when you have have a surplus of coins, but not easy when things are tight. All of us do this more easily together than we do singly. Surely, that is how a <strong>stokvel</strong> came about. Committing to save with others brings about the need to comply, to &ldquo;not let anyone down&rdquo;. &ldquo;Stokvels&rdquo; (known in the West Indies as &ldquo;loan clubs&rdquo;) are a good example of how much easier it is to save &ldquo;together&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Story: In the factory of a large multinational corporationin Harlesden, London, a high percentage of the unskilled workforce were West Indies immigrants. As happens in immigrant situations, a few started out, and over time, pulled more and more of their countrymen and women into the firm. The immigrant population grew. Over years, some married, had children, and found the need to buy houses once they knew they would get permanent residence in England.</p>

<p>There was a problem, however. England, although there was no apartheid, nor any segregation in law, was a toxic place where banks were &ldquo;mysteriously&rdquo; unable to advance mortgage loans to black West Indian immigrants. So, the workers at this plant started a loan club. They worked out &ldquo;how many people&rdquo;, contributing &ldquo;how many pounds&rdquo;, for &ldquo;how many weeks&rdquo; from their wages, would take &ldquo;how long to pay cash for a house&rdquo;. The money was calculated, saved and used, and inside a decade, every &ldquo;loan clubber&rdquo; at this factory bought a house, paid for in cash.</p>

<p>Putting it another way, because of their &hellip; racism?, banks cost themselves the opportunity to earn interest on several hundred houses, and saved thousands for the imigrants who paid cash for their properties in Harlesden.</p>

<p>This was at a time when &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; (read Fascist?) Enoch Powell would bluster &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to live next to one&rdquo; and so on, but Harlesden did not make a name for itself as a hotbed of crime or whatever. It quietly continued as a middle class residential area. Once people owned houses, banks found themselves &ldquo;able&rdquo; to loan money to the new residents. As usual with banks and loans, they only have money to lend when you don&rsquo;t need it. The immigrant workers continued using loan clubs, patiently waiting for their payout turn to purchase cars, alter houses, and so on.</p>

<p>In practice, what were the details? Let&rsquo;s say a Harlesden house sold for 2500 pounds back then. Weekly wages were around 8 pounds without overtime. The decision was they could afford to put 3 pounds per week into the loan club, and out of a total workforce of 850 people, there are 400 in the loan club. That&rsquo;s 1200 pounds per week. Three weeks amounts to 3600 pounds, enough to pay for a house cash, with 900 poounds left over for expenses like electricity, bond charges, whatever. A house can be saved for bought and paid for, every three weeks. 400 members = 400 weeks. Divide by 52. That&rsquo;s slightly less than 8 years.</p>

<p>So, wording it another way, in 8 years, 400 people own a fully paid up house. Not bad. Bad luck, racist banks! The people got 400 houses without your loans! You should have been wide awake instead of lolling around &hellip; What? you were &lsquo;having a midlands&rsquo;? Too bad.</p>
