## ***W***ild ***I***deas: 

There is time here to muse on things, to ponder, and one project we have in mind for the future is to restore our Landini tractor. So, we appeal to any and all associates and friends, if you know of anyone who has done what follows, pleaset let us know. To be clear on this, we prefer to meet a real live person who has done this. We **know** it's all over the net, and people have done it, we just want the real deal straight from someone's experience.

### The Landini repair/restore  question

For a long time, we haven't used tractors, at all. It's many years since we ploughed, and even when we did, the tractor would stand idle for most days in a year. As it is, the Landini has a cracked cylinder head, and that is just the sort of thing that happens to engines that sit cold and dead for months, and then become stressed under load. We are faced with a repair bill. 

What if, instead of a normal cylinder head repair, we replaced the diesal engine with an electric motor? We aren't sure this even **can** be done on the Landini, but we _hope_ that, out there we can find:

+ a forklift engine
+ a forklift battery
+ someone who has done this before.

We don't want something that can drive to town and back. We don't even ***need*** a tractor! But the Landini is a great looking machine, and it would be a pity to lose it.  If we could get it going so as to have something to pull the occasional vehicle out of the mud, or tow a trailer when all the other vehicles are deployed, it would be **so** useful. However, we have constraints: we ...

+ are not in a hurry
+ won't throw money at this project.

Using the Landini for all trailer towing on the farm (i.e. every day) could be a massive saving. Even with the cost of periodic battery replacement over time, savings can be around R150 per day, or R33k per (220 working days) year.

We know that electric motors need almost no maintenance. In the South African Railways, in 1966, class E1 electric locomotives were just trickling in to the shops for their _first overhauls._ They had been in service ***since 1926 - forty years!***. There is a YouTube [ten-year review of a Nissan Leaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qPF11PmP8k). Nothing went wrong in the ten years of owning this car. Nothing broke! Assuming regenerative brakes, the brake pads surely lasted much longer.

So, if you know this has been done, and know the person that did it, or if you are knowledgable about such a conversion and feel you can give good advice as to what we need to shop for, please let us know. Even if we don't have time to do it now (we have a lot on our plate in the next year), it is still a worthwhile project going forward.

### Waterless Toilets

Chemical toilets are possible: most are not too bulky, but we are left with a chemical disposal problem: the effluent must be disposed of at _disposal points_, meaning that we would need to take smelly, chemical effluent to the dorp. Even if Colesberg _has_ such a disposal point, we are not considering this, preferring to somewhow work with nature.

We looked long and hard at retrofitting our buildings with composting toilets, concluding it is too difficult: too much bashing down of walls, excavating concrete, digging floors. We need to look at something else.

The problem with our longstanding flush toilets is that we _use_ good water in the first place, and then we _pollute_ it in the second place. Since we can't easily replace our flush toilets, in what way can we reduce their disadvantages? Using grey water for the toilets can help, but that means retrofitting the plumbing ...

We must work out how to return it to the water table in pristine, or at least good, condition, something that septics don't achieve. One way may be leading effluent through reed beds. Our Oorlogspoort stream is lined with _fluitjiesriet_. We suspect that, like most reeds, it has a huge appetite for water impurities. We are looking to lead a trickle of water down a slight incline in an old cropland, through a half-hectare zigzag maze of reeds, returning clean water to the stream or a pond.

Our plans for the riverine area include buiding a deck for campers. Under the deck will be mesh enclosing equipment storage. We may erect a tent on the deck, and build a waterless toilet close by. We are looking at making our own biochar for that toilet.

## Food Security

Everyone grows _something_ on the farm. We all have allotments. When we talk about food security, we really mean "for our animals", but that doesn't mean we can't do better for ourselves. Sprouted barley fodder has worked, on a tiny scale. We are trying to ramp that up before winter dries everything up.
