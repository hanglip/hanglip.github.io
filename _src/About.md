We know more than we know. When we in the Karoo look at the stars, it is through the eyes of First People. Spirituality here is not something we immediately associate with Inguni or Bantu cutlure. The connection is complete enough between us, the starts and the First Nation, without anything else getting in between.  

It was Xhabbo, interviewed in the Breakwater Prison by WH Bleek, who articulated the indefinable with the words "There is a dream dreaming us". If that isn't the best rendition of what spirituality, wonder, religion, whatever one wishes to call it, is, then please tell what is ...
