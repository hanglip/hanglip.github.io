    Title: Waterless Toilets

Chemical toilets are possible: most are not too bulky, but we are left with a chemical disposal problem: the effluent must be disposed of at _disposal points_, meaning that we would need to take smelly, chemical effluent to the dorp. Even if Colesberg _has_ such a disposal point, we are not considering this, preferring to somewhow work with nature.

We looked long and hard at retrofitting our buildings with composting toilets, concluding it is too difficult: too much bashing down of walls, excavating concrete, digging floors. We need to look at something else.

The problem with our longstanding flush toilets is that we _use_ good water in the first place, and then we _pollute_ it in the second place. Since we can't easily replace our flush toilets, in what way can we reduce their disadvantages? Using grey water for the toilets can help, but that means retrofitting the plumbing ...

We must work out how to return it to the water table in pristine, or at least good, condition, something that septics don't achieve. One way may be leading effluent through reed beds. Our Oorlogspoort stream is lined with _fluitjiesriet_. We suspect that, like most reeds, it has a huge appetite for water impurities. We are looking to lead a trickle of water down a slight incline in an old cropland, through a half-hectare zigzag maze of reeds, returning clean water to the stream or a pond.

Our plans for the riverine area include buiding a deck for campers. Under the deck will be mesh enclosing equipment storage. We may erect a tent on the deck, and build a waterless toilet close by. We are looking at making our own biochar for that toilet.
