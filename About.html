 <p>Usually, blogs invite readers to comment, with a text area to submit below each blog post. This blog doesn&rsquo;t do that, but not because we don&rsquo;t invite responses. We value them, and would prefer them emailed to us on <strong><a href="mailto:hanglipkaroo@gmail.com">hanglipkaroo@gmail.com</a></strong></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>The reason we don&rsquo;t feature instant responses like this is that this is a <em>static blog</em>, not a <em>dynamic blog</em>, and this is a static blog because that way it is hosted for <strong>free</strong>. If it included comments, that would fall away. We don&rsquo;t at this stage want a &ldquo;bells and whistles&rdquo; blog.</p></blockquote>

<p>We know more than we know. When we in the Karoo look at the stars, it is through the eyes of First People. The connection is complete enough between us, the stars and the First Nation, without anything else getting in between.</p>

<p>It was Xhabbo, interviewed in the Breakwater Prison by WH Bleek, who articulated the indefinable with the words &ldquo;There is a dream dreaming us&rdquo;. If that isn&rsquo;t the best rendition of what spirituality, wonder, religion, whatever one wishes to call it, is, then please tell what is &hellip;</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-our-it-technology-at-hanglip">Notes on our IT Technology at Hanglip</h3>

<p>We use Excel spreadsheets for budgeting, costing and projections. Jasper uses VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) here and there, behind Excel, to automate repetitive tasks. He <em>could</em> use LibreOffice, and has done through the years, but there is a drawback: StarBasic (these &lsquo;office&rsquo; suites came from a German office suite name StarOffice) their version of BASIC language, takes much longer to develop in than VBA. There are no programmer aids: no IntelliSense, no code completion, no easy help. They support Java and Python too, but similarly without programmer aids, and the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is rudimentary.</p>

<p>Excel and the like have their uses on the desktop, but as soon as they are scaled beyond four walls of an office, <em>uses</em> powerfully morph into <em>abuses</em>. Excel was even blamed for the London Whale financial collapse, whereas the fault was actually not with Excel at all: it was with Excel professional workers. Crucial spreadsheet work was released untested. Of course, blame fell on the IT professionals. It was later found they had done as they were told, were <em>instructed</em> to perpetrate fraud. They just couldn&rsquo;t see that for themselves, because they were steeped in IT, not in finance.</p>

<p>There is more of this chicanery going around than one can possibly know about. VW similarly blamed their programmers for falsifying emissions, but it was found there too that the programmers did what they were told to. It was quite a story, and actually very simple: I read that it went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p><strong>If steering wheel is not being used, this is a test, <em>so reduce pollution figures</em></strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vehicles are tested on test beds, not of the open road, so the software simply returned false figures when the steering was unused.</p>

<p>On Hanglip, Excel is further used for payslips, but we intend to move into web technology, so that we can do things like invoicing and reporting on our phones. The advantage of web technology is that the software is server-based, meaning there is only one copy of the program. Updates are applied to one program on one server, and that&rsquo;s the end of it. With the old desktop model, Gigabytes of updates are download at <strong>our cost</strong> every month.</p>

<p>Nobody seems to care that companies like Microsoft from the start released buggy software on the market purely to BE FIRST on the market. Then they set about re-writing the program to work like it should, downloading what they should have got right first time, all at our expense. To me that is fraud.</p>

<p>This blog is created with a blogging tool known as <strong>Frog</strong>, written by one Greg Hendershot, using a programming language named <strong>Racket</strong>. Racket was developed from another language named <strong>Scheme</strong>. itelf a subset of LISP. LISP was invented by John McCarthy in the 1958, making it 62 years old. It became the favoured language for programming articial intelligence. Understandably, since these languages have been around for this long, most bugs have been corrected.</p>

<p>The blogging tool does exactly &lsquo;what it says on the tin&rsquo;, so there was actually no need to involve ourselves in Scheme programming, though Jasper was prepared to have a go where necessary. One great thing about Racket is that it works identically on Windows, Linux and Apple IOS. Jasper would prefer to do everything on Linux, but it doesn&rsquo;t really work out, because in the real world, everyone has a PC with Windows already installed on it, and quite often that includes Microsoft in the purchase price. For spreadsheets with no macros, that is easy - LibreOffice is a workalike.</p>
