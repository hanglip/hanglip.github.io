### DRAFT BAREBONES - SHARING PROJECTS WITH HANGLIP ASSOCIATES

## Approach 

<!-- more -->

1. SET different Associate involvement styles & levels

...Staff associates, Friend associates, Fanmily associates ...

1. CONSIDER legal aspects for future protection iro the family Trust

   The need to specify that renting land does not confer total freedom on renters. We have to approve their MO when it comes to soil regeneration, for example

1. OUTLINE scope or scale e.g. Limit to Old Land Restoration?

   Perhaps associates may come with a viable business plan, not exactly soil regeneration, but profitable pig operation that suits us

1. DESIGN Monitoring & Reward (If any)

   Consider how to measure progress, and awards for outstanding results

1. LIMIT Timeline (1 to 2 years) to end point (family Trust decides continuation Y/N?)

   Mostly, initial preparation (Zai, or whatever), will be concentrated, after which maintenance is all that is needed

1. Concerned solely with endeavours resulting in permanent trend/result within timeframe

   Can we be open minded about other aims?
