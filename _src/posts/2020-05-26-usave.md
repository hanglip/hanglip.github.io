Shop until you drop (down those few steps).

Imagine, now, if all our rail branch lines weren't closed, farm sidings could be served by a **SaveU Stimela!**. Just saying ... 

It takes a pandemic for people to realise how totally _dof_ you have to be to build a railway line (they last a hundreds years), and then close it down after 30 years. 

The British Govt recently budgeted £500 million Pounds to reopen branch lines serving people isolated since the lines were closed in the 60s (unless they can afford a car, and then what do you do with that in lockdown?). 

HALF A BILLION £££! Oops ...
