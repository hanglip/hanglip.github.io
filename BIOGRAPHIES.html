<p>Maeder has been in politics, journalism, teaching and farming.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-major-influences-in-the-farming">What are your major influences in the farming?</h2>

<blockquote>
 <p>Neil Tainton’s Natal University book <strong>Veld Management in South Africa</strong>, is probably first prize for me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>Then there are a host of other researchers in veld, environment and land affairs that I honour and respect very highly. Among these are chiefly Drs Sue Milton and Richard Deane of <a href="http://www.renu-karoo.co.za">Renu Karoo</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>Dr Cherryl Walker and the teams of researchers around Stellenbosch University. Dr William Beinart of Oxford University. And much work done through the universities of the eastern Cape, Pretoria, Rhodes. In general I admire the work done by many government departments and in the United Nations agencies.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>I am much and widely influenced by many Hanglip associates – they know who they are. Jasper Cook is an inspiration for me. So are and John Seymour in Sustainable Agriculture, and Masanobu Fukuoka of <strong>One Straw Revolution</strong> ane Dr EF Schumacher of <strong>Small is Beautiful</strong>. And many more people in the communities of Colesberg, and beyond &hellip; Not least of my wife Les, and our four children Mark, Miles, Kath, Ken.</p></blockquote>

 <p>And….</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="jasper-cook">JASPER COOK</h3>

<p><strong>Q &amp; A with Jasper Cook</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you know Maeder Osler?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>We go back to early 60s. Shortly before Maeder became NUSAS President, he was a regular supper guest at our house in Scotsville, Pietermaritzburg, two short blocks down from the UNP campus. Other regular supper guests from or related to UNP were Hugh &amp; Liz Lewin, John Lloyd, Caroline White, HWD &ldquo;Cake&rdquo; Manson, Cathy Shallis (now Brubeck), Michael and Lettie Gardiner. It&rsquo;s a long list! Maeder is closer in age to my late brother, Al Cook, and for a time shared a flat with John Lloyd, who I regarded as my best friend later.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Have you remained in contact since those days?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>No. I exiled myself to England from 1967 through Jan 1971, and Maeder socialised with my sister Colleen, and her husband Mike Taylor, while he studied Archaelogy at UCT. So, I remained in touch via Colleen</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Did you see one another sporadically over the years, or not at all until recently?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>When Maeder started <em>Toverberg Indaba</em>, Colleen (who loved a road trip) and I (who love a train trip, although I did once drive down) would sometimes head down from Johannesburg to type-set the paper. We used <em>WordPerfect 5.1</em> in those days!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>Both of us were greatly impressed with Maeder&rsquo;s courage and innovation starting a tri-lingual newspaper in Colesberg, and wanted to do our bit. It was impressive enough to just <strong>start a newspaper</strong>, let alone a liberal one, and in three languages!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Why here, the Great Karoo?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>My grandfather, Clarence Every, farmed on &ldquo;Vinkelfontein&rdquo;, midway between Noupoort, Middelburg, and Hanover. From before I can even remember, we boarded the train every Christmas, to spend the holidays on that farm for some years, and then later on my unclde Dirk Viljoen&rsquo;s farm &ldquo;Slaaifontein&rdquo; not far away, west of the same triple-platberg towering over Vinkelfontein.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>My dad was a civil servant. We did not have a car. So he used his civil servant train concession every year. All four of us siblings longed far more for the Karoo than for PMB and the midlands of then Natal. It&rsquo;s a matter of where the heart is.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re a musician. What about farming?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>I was never <em>only</em> a musician. After dropping out of UNP Fine Arts, I started my working life out as a stoker on steam locomotives in Empangeni, in then Zululand. After that, I exiled myself to England where I worked as a labourer for four years. It was only when the Special Branch set about a process that got me fired (for being an &ldquo;agitator&rdquo;) from my job (which I happily thought would be my lifelong career) as a shipping Warehouse Administative Manager in Durban in 1973, that I was forced to take up music full time. I had not regarded myself as good enough, but in the end, I made the cut!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;suffered&rdquo;, if you like, all my life from &ldquo;urban/rural&rdquo; conflict, and &hellip; rural won! We&rsquo;ve all seen farming change so much through the years.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>You say farming has changed?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>I am influenced by the memory of my grandfather&rsquo;s farm. It was the smallest farm in the district. He was warned that he would not scratch a living from it. In the end, he did quite well enough, because he had the energy and the nous to run a &ldquo;farm within a farm&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>He kept Jersey and Guernsey milkers, a bit unknown for the Karoo in those days, and grew lucerne to feed them, also baled it for dry times, built a huge dam to irrigate the lucerne. He sold cream to the Queenstown dairy, skimmed milk was fed to the pigs, a litter of which he grew out and sold yearly, and chickens followed the cows and pigs, providing eggs and meat. Springbok culling also provided meat. The cream and pigs paid most of the bills, and he needed very little from town.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>He couldn&rsquo;t do this today: dropping cream cans with a <em>laaimeester</em> at Noupoort, whom he knew and relied upon to consign it correctly, does not happen today. Rail doesn&rsquo;t serve farmers today, except to carry some machinery and maybe grain, sometimes. It all went onto our roads.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>My grandfather&rsquo;s farm was the twenty-seventh farm bought by a wealthy farmer back in the day, and that has become the trend. If you want to earn more, you buy more farms!</p></blockquote>
