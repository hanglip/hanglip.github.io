### ABOUT THIS BLOG: Note from Jasper Cook (creator of this blog)

>Usually, blogs invite readers to comment, with a text area to submit below each blog post for the purpose.  This blog doesn't include that feature, but not because we don't invite responses. We value them, and would prefer them emailed to us on **maedercskaroo@gmail.com**.

>The reason we don't feature instant repsonsiveness slike this is that this is a static blog, not a dynamic blog. And, the reason that this is a static blog is that, as long as it is static, it is hosted for free. If it included comments, that would fall awar. We don't at this stage want a "bells and whistles" blog.
