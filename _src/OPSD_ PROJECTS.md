** Sprouted Barley 

Sprouted barley underpins our small livestock programmes. It is palatable to all farm animals, and easy to produce. Supported with dry matter where necessary, this is in itself a job incubator.

<a name="quails">Quails for eggs & meat</a>

A single quail is an ideal portion of protein. Quails grow quickly, so to produce a daily batch of quail for school meals, one needs to begin only 6 weeks before shcool term starts, and keep them coming alon.
