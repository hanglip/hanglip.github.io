# Stream Dream

## Conservancy

A five minute walk from the Groothuis descends to our "river running through it", the Oorlogspoort River. This is a gun free zone.

To enhance Associate experience of the river, we propose to:

- install some rustic seating, and a braai area

- erect a suitably "green" toilet in a reed enclosure within 30m of the seating

- install a water point with hand basin, for drinking and hand washing

We welcome suggestions: maybe a hammock?  Thatched shade? Please let us know on our email (cf Home Page)
