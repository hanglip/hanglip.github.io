These online pages serve to acquaint our Associates (especially during COVID-19 Lockdown as at the time of writing) with developments on the farm.  

We added a page assessing our progress in terms of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. See **SDG** on the Navigation Tab.

We are mulling over plans to regenerate worked out old crop lands (though no-one would believe, after our good rains, how sombre these lands looked only a month ago). Plans vary from job creation to soil and plant regeneration, involving both planting and small livestock.

In the last century, most Karoo farms had a core farm, or "Farm within a farm", if you like. Accountants through the years have advised extensive farm livestock specialisation, to the point that these small (dairy, stud ram, pig, chicken, goat) operations took a back seat. We believe that we can host a breeding pair of one or more of these animals on each land, the profits from these serving to pay for restoration projects.
