Each Hectare Haven could carry two cows (one in milk), a dozen chickens, a few dozen quails, a breeding pair of pigs. One staff member should cope with four of these units daily. Livestock can be shared amongst many people or not, with surpluses accruing to the farm when there are no dwellers to consume them. Rent on the lands is exected to be nominal, and Jasper still has to cost the dwelling plan to come up with a rental on that. If a number of associates can afford to share such a unit, rental on the whole unit should be very little when compared with city rents. Plus, for the summer growing season, surpluses may wipe some or all of that out, depending on what people want to grow/raise. Cows normally have seven calves in their lifetime. If a style of "no money changes hands" is adopted, then the farm would want to keep calves 1, 3, 5 & 7, with calves 2, 4 & 6 accruing to the renter/sharer.
