#  Stream Dream

## Oorlogspoort River

Oorlogspoort River is a river only in arid country terms.  It's the sort of river that Leonard Fleming wrote about (in "A Fool on the Veld"), where one dives into the river, then rises and pats the dust off.

It is, at best, a stream, and we feel very lucky that Hangklip straddles it. Maeder sometimes uses the term "drainage system" for these gravitional run-off features, found all over the Karoo.

For us, it's a fulcrum, if you like, with two main components to it uppermost in our thinking about it.  It is rich in:

- pre- and modern (Boer War) history.
- promise for a future conservancy
