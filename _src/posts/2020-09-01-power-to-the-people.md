## Conclusion

The policy started in 2003/2004 to **truck coal** to Majuba has spawned an entire ecosystem that feeds off the largesse of a state-owned enterprise that was out of control. 

A sense of entitlement has developed among parasitic elements both within Eskom and externally to extract as much as they can, with **little sense as to value for money and efficiency**, the **wellbeing and sustainability of the host body**, or the **national interest**.

This begs the question as to whether the extended project delays on the Majuba rail project may have been **deliberately engineered by individuals** – internal and external to Eskom – whose revenue streams, and those of their politically connected associates, friends and family members in the local coal mining and road transport businesses, would be negatively impacted by the timely completion of the Majuba rail project. 

The fire incident on the offloading tippler takeout conveyor and silo in December 2019, which has since **stopped all deliveries of coal by rail** to Majuba power station, is a particular case in point. DM
