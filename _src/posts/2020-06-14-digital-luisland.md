    DIGITAL LUISLANG

This one by Jasper Cook alone.

If one believes the hype, Python is the:

+ world's most popular programming language today. 
+ language of choice  for robotic programming. 

Actually, it is neither.

**Java** is still far away the most-used programming language world wide. 

**LISP**, (half a century old) is still the language of robotics and AI (Articifial Intelligence). 

I am an _oujong_ in more ways than one: I like to mix old and new. Loving tradition, I also believe we learn from our mistakes, and "_things_ get better". Would you trade a Subaru for a Model T Ford? 

So, while a part of me wants to stick with those old languages, which are by now thoroughly bug-free and really work, I also realise that software doesn't change much over the years. So, why be a stick-in-the-mud. Let's go with the new. That equally doesn't mean **me changing to programming Python!** I will do another post on why. It's a **large** subject. For now, just know that I always go for _oujong_ ... a mix of age, wisdom and tradition, with new.

Taking _trends_ however, it is impossible to ignore what an influence the tiny credit card sized Raspberry Pi has had, and it, more than any other force, is responsible for the surge in Python use and popularity. When it comes to **new projects**, including robotics, Python is the either Here, or the Next Big Thing.

Given the uptake of coding in schools generally, and Python particularly, it's reassuring to know that our education system is said to be introducing both Python coding and robotics into our school syllabi "soon" (or, as Jerry Pournelle used to say, in Byte Magazine) **Real Soon, Now**.

In a sketch by Herman Charles Bosman, a social worker claimed that every hobo really wants a home, a job, a family (what Zorba the Greek described as _'the full catastrophe_'). This wish, this social worker said, is expressed by the hobo with the wistful rejoinder _"that will be the day"_.

I feel a bit like that about schools, python and robotics: "_that will be the day_". However, here, I am not being _negative_,  but _impatient_! As my mother would say:

>Lord, grant me patience. But, _HURRY!_

Currently, every youth I see uses devices for _TikTok_ and _WhatsApp_, maybe _Facebook_, which is becoming **so __last year__**. Notice that of the them, WhatsApp is the most readily useful, but less popular than TikTok. We like to be able to message people and pass photos around, but we like even more to be in a movie! That's TikTok.

That is why I am impatient. It puzzles me how most people using these apps (i.e. who  **consumer** apps) are so incurious as to how they are made, and where they come from. I would expect more interest in developing software and gadgets ... I mean, I dreamed about "engine driver" as a kid, and came pretty close!

School will demystify apps and coding. Learners will see there is no great mystery in them, no _magic_ in electronics, and that coding is reachable. Programs are like cooking recipes (they can be smaller or much larger). I am _so_ impatient to see the flowering of inventionss and hacking (not cracking) that this will bring about! 

For those who don't know, 'hacking' is the digital equivalent of "_'n boer maak 'n plan_". 'Cracking' is the criminal business of grabbing passwords and emptying peopole's bank accounts, or breaking, on computer, into defence systems.

The Afrikaans word for 'python' is _luislang_ ... 'lazy snake'. I hope Python comes quicker into our schools than these creatures move in real life!
