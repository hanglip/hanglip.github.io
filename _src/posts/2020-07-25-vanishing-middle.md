EF Schumacher onced coined an economic law: the "Law of the Vanishing Middle". Expressing disappointment that it did not work on his waistline, he explained that this law was about scale in economic activity, specifically that economic acticity consists in huge mega-corporations, and tiny businesses with few middle-sized companies in between - trending gigantism. 

He said this in the '70s, but it now looks like prophecy:. Apple was once said to be rich enough to buy the US! Who would be surprised to hear that Apple and Amazon (leaving out another "A" for now, nanely "Alhpabet" aka Google) between them can buy a few continents (if they haven't already)?
