Accountants through the years have advised extensive farm livestock specialisation, to the point that these small (dairy, stud ram, pig, chicken, goat) operations took a back seat. We believe that we can host a breeding pair of one or more of these animals on each land, the profits from these serving to pay for restoration projects.</p>")) ((? . 1) f post (u .
