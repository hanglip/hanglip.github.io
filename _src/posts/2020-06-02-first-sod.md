Here's a first:

Allen and Sors dug a hole to plant the first tree in our Old Land regeneration programme:

It was fairly hard going: as can be seen, there is little vegetation around, and the soil is cement-like, fine and dense. We will need to mulch a lot to increase friability, and moisture retention. 

The plan further is to:

+ plant three rows of leguminous (nitrogen fixing) trees in each plot, with ...
+ five trees per row, (in this camp, which is smaller) spaced 10m apart, and ...
+ shrubs between trees

Then we will alley-crop between these rows, planting either cereal grasses like barley and oats, or cucurbits and other seasonal vegetables.
