<h3 id="jasper-cook">JASPER COOK</h3>

<p><strong>Q &amp; A with Jasper Cook</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do you know Maeder Osler?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>We go back to early 60s. Shortly before Maeder became NUSAS President, he was a regular guest at our house in Scotsville, Pietermaritzburg, two short blocks down from the UNP campus. Other regular guests from or related to UNP were Hugh &amp; Liz Lewin, John Lloyd, Caroline White, HWD &ldquo;Cake&rdquo; Manson, Cathy Shallis (now Brubeck), Michael and Lettie Gardiner. It&rsquo;s a long list! Maeder is closer in age to my late brother, Al Cook, and for a time shared a flat with John Lloyd, who I regarded as my best friend later.</p></blockquote>
<!-- more-->

<p><strong>Have you remained in contact since those days?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>No. I exiled myself to England from 1967 through Jan 1971, and Maeder was in touch with my sister Colleen, and her husband Mike Taylor, while Mike studied Archaelogy at UCT. I remained in touch via Colleen.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Did you see one another sporadically over the years, or not at all until recently?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>When Maeder started <em>Toverberg Indaba</em>, Colleen (who loved a road trip) and I (who love a train trip) would sometimes head down from Johannesburg to type-set the paper. We used <em>WordPerfect 5.1</em> in those days (the 80s). Both of us were greatly impressed with Maeder&rsquo;s courage and innovation starting a tri-lingual newspaper in Colesberg, and wanted to do our bit. It was impressive enough to just <strong>start a newspaper</strong>, let alone a liberal one, and in three languages!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Why here, the Great Karoo?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>My grandfather, Clarence Every, farmed on &ldquo;Vinkelfontein&rdquo;, midway between Noupoort, Middelburg, and Hanover. From before I can even remember, we boarded the train every Christmas, to spend the holidays on that farm for some years, and then later on my uncle Dirk Viljoen&rsquo;s farm &ldquo;Slaaifontein&rdquo; not far away, west of the same triple-platberg towering over Vinkelfontein.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>My dad was a civil servant. We did not have a car. So he used his civil servant train concession every year. All four of us siblings longed far more for the Karoo than for PMB and the midlands of then Natal. It&rsquo;s a matter of where the heart is.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re a musician. What about farming?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>I was never <em>only</em> a musician. After dropping out of UNP Fine Arts, I started my working life out as a stoker on steam locomotives in Empangeni, in then Zululand.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/img/Jasper_19d_EPG.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 450px;" /></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>After that, I exiled myself to England where I worked as a labourer for four years. It was only when the Special Branch set about a process that got me fired (for being an &ldquo;agitator&rdquo;) from my job (which I happily thought would be my lifelong career) as a shipping Warehouse Administative Manager in Durban in 1973, that I was forced to take up music full time. I had not regarded myself as good enough, but in the end, I made the cut!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;suffered&rdquo;, if you like, all my life from &ldquo;urban/rural&rdquo; conflict, and &hellip; rural won! Partly because, as we&rsquo;ve all seen, farming has changed so much through the years.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>You say farming has changed?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
 <p>I am influenced by the memory of my grandfather&rsquo;s farm. It was the smallest farm in the district. He was warned that he would not scratch a living from it. In the end, he did well enough, because he had the energy and the nous to run a &ldquo;farm within a farm&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>He kept Jersey and Guernsey milkers, a bit unknown for the Karoo in those days, and grew lucerne to feed them, also baled it for dry times, built a huge dam to irrigate the lucerne. He sold cream to the Queenstown dairy, skimmed milk was fed to the pigs, a litter of which he grew out and sold yearly, and chickens followed the cows and pigs, providing eggs and meat. Springbok culling also provided meat. The cream and pigs paid most of the bills, and he needed very little from town.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>He couldn&rsquo;t do this today: dropping cream cans with a <em>laaimeester</em> at Noupoort, whom he knew and relied upon to consign it correctly, does not happen today. Rail doesn&rsquo;t serve farmers today, except to carry some machinery and maybe grain, sometimes. It all went onto our roads.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>My grandfather&rsquo;s farm was the twenty-seventh farm bought by a wealthy farmer back in the day, and that has become the trend. If you want to earn more, you buy more farms!</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-your-greatest-achievement">What is your greatest achievement?</h2>

<blockquote>
 <p><strong>Nothing tops my children</strong>. They are all great inspirations to me. They all made good and happy lives for themselves. How many people do that?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>A few other things stand out:</p></blockquote>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>Performing with the African Jazz Pioneers at the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela in 1994, and eight happy years with that band in all.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>A database for labour lawyers resulting in reinstatement of 14000 workers fired by SATS (South African Transport Services), in the 80s. Of those 14000, 3000 had families that were turfed out of their homes when fired. Reinstatement meant they were no longer homeless. This was me wearing another hat: my IT hat.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Performing with the African Jazz Pioneers before 300 thousand people in Rome on Workers Day, 1993. The largest crowd I saw before then was 250 thouasand at the Rolling Stones Free Concert in Hyde Park</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>recording on three albums with Hugh Masekela, five with the African Jazz Pioneers, 19 albums in South Africa in all</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>Happiest live music event (there <em>so</em> many) was performing in the Jonas Gwangwa Orchestra in the Civic Theatre in Johannesburg</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>four very happy years with Dennis Mpali&rsquo;s band</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>&ldquo;suit&rdquo; jobs &hellip; It goes without saying that I, declared from early life as an &ldquo;outy&rdquo;, was never going to be big on corporate stuff: corporates, to the last one, went along with apartheid, and that didn&rsquo;t wash for me. However, I ended my working life happily in a small but great IT firm, <a href="http://www.krs.co.za">Khanyisa Real Systems</a> until retirement. If KRS were big on &ldquo;suits&rdquo;, this would have been my happiest &ldquo;suit&rdquo; job, but KRS are delightfully more interested in how you think rather than how you look. Those three years somehow feel like an achievement, almost like &ldquo;all is forgiven, Jasper&rdquo;!</p></li></ul>

<p>Looking back, I hear the words of Slim Callaghan, one of whodunit author Peter Cheney&rsquo;s characters:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>*<em>&ldquo;We get there, and who the hell cares how!&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>
